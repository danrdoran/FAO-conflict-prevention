{"page": 13, "text": "xi Foreword In 2015, the United Nations Member States set ambitious goals for the world with the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which offers a unique framework to come together around a renewed effort at preventing human suffering. The Agenda, which is universal, integrated and indivisible in nature, not only aims to end poverty and hunger, to ensure healthy lives and quality education and to protect the environment—but also to reduce inequalities and promote peaceful, just and inclusive societies. Violent conﬂ ict is increasingly recognized as one of the big obstacles to reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Its dramatic resurgence over the last few years has caused immense human suffering and has enormous global impact. Violent conﬂ icts have also become more complex and protracted, involving more nonstate groups and regional and international actors. And they are increasingly linked to global challenges such as climate change, natural disasters, cyber security and transnational organized crime. It is projected that more than half of the people living in poverty will be found in countries affected by high levels of violence by 2030. This is utterly contrary to the promise contained in the 2030 Agenda to leave no one behind. As the human, social and financial costs and complexity of violent conflict and its global impact grow, we"}
{"page": 13, "text": "This is utterly contrary to the promise contained in the 2030 Agenda to leave no one behind. As the human, social and financial costs and complexity of violent conflict and its global impact grow, we must ask ourselves: how can the global community more effectively prevent violent conflict? At the United Nations, we believe that prevention means doing everything we can to help countries avert the outbreak of crises that take a high toll on humanity, undermining institutions and capacities to achieve peace and development. We mean rededicating ourselves to the United Nations Charter, the mandate of Agenda 2030, protecting and respecting human rights, and ensuring that our assistance goes to those who need it the most. Prevention should permeate everything we do. It should cut across all pillars of the United Nations’ work and unite us for more effective delivery. This study is a contribution to our internal reﬂ ection on the broader challenges of prevention. At the World Bank Group, we believe that preventing fragility, conﬂ ict and violence is central to reducing poverty and achieving shared prosperity. Social and economic development have important roles to play in this effort, so we are doubling the amount of resources to address issues of fragility, conﬂ ict and violence as part of the 18th replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA), our fund for the po"}
{"page": 13, "text": "we are doubling the amount of resources to address issues of fragility, conﬂ ict and violence as part of the 18th replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA), our fund for the poorest countries. We are ensuring that all of our operations can contribute to this effort in several ways: by introducing more ﬂ exibility and adaptability in our programs; by increasing our focus on the risks of fragility, conﬂ ict and violence, and on various crises faced by our clients; by improving our regional efforts; and by addressing some of the worst consequences of conﬂ ict such as forced displacement."}
{"page": 14, "text": "xii Foreword Each of our institutions brings a unique and complementary set of expertise and tools to the table in accordance with its mandate. We can already see the results of our intensiﬁ ed collaboration around conﬂ ict, violence and fragility in several countries. But we can achieve more together. We need to better harness our institutions’ instruments and resources to support this shared agenda. This joint study on the prevention of violent conﬂ ict—a ﬁ rst in the history of our institutions—was initiated in 2016 and conducted by a team of staff members from the United Nations and the World Bank Group, in a spirit of fostering closer collaboration to deliver at the country level. It reﬂ ects a process of research and intense global consultation aimed at providing ideas on how development approaches can better interact with other tools to prevent violent conﬂ ict. This study, principally based on academic research, beneﬁ ted immensely from consultations with a variety of actors including governments. It is therefore our hope that some of the ﬁ ndings will usefully inform global policy making. This study is one element of a much broader partnership and a first step in working jointly to address the immense challenges of our time. We look forward to continuing the pursuit of knowledge together and to applying that knowledge together in support of the people we serve. António"}

{"page": 19, "text": "xvii Executive Summary A surge in violent conﬂ icts in recent years has left a trail of human suffering, displace- ment, and protracted humanitarian need. In 2016, more countries experienced vio- lent conﬂ ict than at any time in nearly 30 years. 1 Reported battle-related deaths in 2016 increased tenfold from the post–Cold War low of 2005, and terrorist attacks and fatalities also rose sharply over the past 10 years (GTD 2017). This surge in violence afﬂ icts both low- and middle-income countries with rela- tively strong institutions and calls into question the long-standing assumption that peace will accompany income growth and the expectations of steady social, economic, and political advancement that deﬁ ned the end of the twentieth century (Fearon 2010; Humphreys and Varshney 2004; World Economic Forum 2016). If current trends persist, by 2030—the horizon set by the international community for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—more than half of the world’s poor will be living in countries affected by high levels of violence (OECD 2015). The beneﬁ t of preventive action, then, seems self-evident. Indeed, the global archi- tecture for peace and security, forged in the aftermath of World War II, is grounded in the universal commitment to “save succeed- ing generations from the scourge of war” (United Nations Charter, preamble).

With conﬂ ict today often simulta- neously subnational and transnational, sus- tained, inclusive, and targeted engagement is needed at all levels. This reality has accelerated momentum for countries at risk and for the interna- tional community to focus on improving efforts at preventing “the outbreak, escala- tion, recurrence, or continuation of con- ﬂ ict” (UN General Assembly 2016; UN Security Council 2016). Y et, at present, spending and efforts on prevention repre- sent only a fraction of the amount spent on crisis response and reconstruction. 2 A shift away from managing and responding to cri- ses and toward preventing conﬂ ict sustain- ably, inclusively, and collectively can save lives and greatly reduce these costs.

Therefore, while a holistic framework is essential to implementing prevention, the ﬁ ndings and recommendations of this study do not apply to all organizations in the same way. This study seeks to improve the way in which domestic development processes interact with security, diplomatic, justice, and human rights efforts to prevent con- ﬂ icts from becoming violent. Its key audi- ences are national policy makers and staff of multilateral and regional institutions. The background research and literature reviews, including 19 case studies, were pre- pared in partnership with leading think tanks and academic institutions.

Eight Key Messages for Prevention The study’s ﬁ ndings revolve around eight key messages: • Violent conﬂ ict has increased after decades of relative decline. Direct deaths in war, numbers of displaced populations, military spending, and terrorist incidents, among others, have all surged since the beginning of the century. A rapidly evolving global context presents risks that transcend national borders and add to the complexity of conﬂ ict. This places the onus on policy makers at all levels, from local to global, to make a more concerted effort to bring their tools and instruments to bear in an effective and complementary way. • The human and economic cost of conﬂ icts around the world requires all of those concerned to work more collaboratively. The SDGs should be at the core of this approach. Development actors need to provide more support to national and regional prevention agendas through targeted, ﬂ exible, and sustained engagement. Prevention agendas, in turn, should be integrated into development policies and efforts, because prevention is cost-effective, saves lives, and safeguards development gains. • The best way to prevent societies from descending into crisis, includ"}

For all countries, addressing inequalities and exclusion, making institutions more inclusive, and ensuring that development strategies are risk-informed are central to preventing the fraying of the social fabric that could erupt into crisis. • The primary responsibility for preventive action rests with states, both through their national policy and their governance of the multilateral system. However, in today’s shifting global landscape, states are often one actor among many. States are increasingly called to work with each other and with other actors to keep their countries on a pathway to peace. • Exclusion from access to power, opportunity, services, and security creates fertile ground for mobilizing group grievances to violence, especially in areas with weak state capacity or legitimacy or in the context of human rights abuses.

Fostering the participation of young people as well as of the organizations, movements, and networks that represent them is crucial. Women’s meaningful participation in all aspects of peace and security is critical to effectiveness, including in peace processes, where it has been shown to have a direct impact on the sustainability of agreements reached. • Alongside efforts to build institutional capacity to contain violence when it does occur, acting preventively entails fostering systems that create incentives for peaceful and cooperative behavior. In order to achieve more effective prevention, new mechanisms need to be established that will allow greater synergy to be achieved much earlier among the various tools and instruments of prevention, in particular, diplomacy and mediation, security, and development. This study demonstrates that prevention works. Many countries have successfully managed high-risk conﬂ icts and avoided descents into violence.

There is no one formula, as each situation is speciﬁ c to the actors, institutions, and structures of each society, but common threads can be teased out of these experiences. This study also shows that prevention is cost-effective. Analysis undertaken for this study ﬁ nds that a system for preventing the outbreak of violence would be economi- cally beneﬁ cial. Even in the most pessimistic scenario, where preventive action is rarely successful, the average net savings are close to US$5 billion per year. In the most opti- mistic scenario, the net savings are almost US$70 billion per year (Mueller 2017). The State of Violent Conﬂ ict While interstate conﬂ ict remains rare, the number of violent conﬂ icts within states has increased since 2010. Furthermore, high-intensity warfare in certain countries has increased the number of fatalities caused by these conﬂ icts, with the number of reported battle-related deaths rising sharply and in 2014 reaching the highest numbers recorded in 20 years (Allansson, Melander, and Themnér 2017; Sundberg, Eck, and Kreutz 2012).

Most battle deaths occur in a small number of conﬂ icts; the three deadliest countries in 2016 (Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Syrian Arab Republic) incurred more than 76 percent of all fatalities. However, even if battle deaths drop signiﬁ cantly as ﬁ ghting declines in these countries, these conﬂ icts are expected to be protracted and risks of new outbreaks remain high (Dupuy et al. 2017). Much of this violence remains entrenched in low-income countries; however, some of today’s deadliest and most complex conﬂ icts are occurring in middle-income countries, underscoring the fact that income and wealth are not a guarantee of peace (Geneva Declaration Secretariat 2015; OECD 2016). Armed groups have grown in number, diversity, and scope. Many of these groups are not linked to states. They include rebels, militias, armed trafﬁ cking groups, and vio- lent extremist groups that may coalesce around a grievance, an identity, an ideology, or a claim to economic or political resources. Membership and alliances tend to evolve over time, depending on resources or leadership. Violence is increasingly spreading beyond national borders: 18 out of 47 state- based violent conﬂ icts were international- ized in 2016, 5 more than reported in any year since the end of World War II, except for 2015, when 20 were internationalized (UCDP 2017).

{"page": 22, "text": "xx Executive Summary doubled (UCDP 2017). Many more civilian deaths result from indirect effects of con- ﬂ ict, such as unmet medical needs, food insecurity, inadequate shelter, or contami- nation of water (Small Arms Survey 2011; UNESCWA 2017). Violent conﬂ ict is forcibly displacing people in record numbers. An estimated 65.6 million people are now forcibly dis- placed from their homes, driven primarily by violence (UNHCR 2017). Between 2005 and 2016, the number of internally dis- placed persons increased more than ﬁ vefold (UNDP 2016; UNHCR 2017). The number of refugees nearly doubled over the same period, with the majority (55 percent) of refugees coming from Afghanistan, the Republic of South Sudan, and Syria (UNHCR 2017). More than half of the world’s refugees are children, and many of them have been separated from their fami- lies (UNHCR 2017). Violent conﬂ ict affects men and women differently. While men make up the majority of combatants during conﬂ ict and are more likely to die from the direct effects of violence, women also face a continuum of insecurity before, during, and after conﬂ ict (Crespo- Sancho 2017). Sexual and gender-based vio- lence tends to be higher in conﬂ ict and postconﬂ ict settings, as does recruitment of girls into trafﬁ cking, sexual slavery, and forced marriage (Crespo-Sancho 2017; Kelly 2017; UNESCWA 2017; UN Secretary- General 2015; UN Women"}

In insecure contexts, girls’ mobility is often highly restricted, limiting their access to school, employment, and other opportunities (UN Women 2015). For children and youth, the long-term effects of exposure to violence and the adversities of daily life in a high-violence context are associated with a range of chal- lenges (Miller and Rasmussen 2010). These include increased risk of perpetrating vio- lence or being a victim of violence later in life, psychological trauma, and negative effects on cognitive and social development (Betancourt et al. 2012; Blattman 2006; Huesmann and Kirwil 2007; Leckman, Panter-Brick, and Salah 2014; Shonkoff and Garner 2012). The costs associated with the economic losses caused by conﬂ ict put a severe strain on state capacity. Afghanistan’s per capita income has remained at its 1970s level due to the continued war, and Somalia’s per capita income has dropped by more than 40 percent over the same period (Mueller and T obias 2016). Such effects can spread to sur- rounding countries in the region.

On aver- age, countries bordering a high-intensity conﬂ ict experience an annual decline of 1.4 percentage points in gross domestic prod- uct (GDP) and an increase of 1.7 points in inﬂ ation (Rother et al. 2016). The Need for Prevention in an Interdependent World The nature of violent conﬂ ict is not changing in isolation. The increase in vio- lent conﬂ icts has emerged in a global con- text where the balance of geopolitical power is in ﬂ ux and a push for more inclu- sive governance is bringing new voices and new demands. Proxy wars are no lon- ger the exclusive purview of traditional great powers. At the same time, the num- ber of societies that have adopted more inclusive forms of political, economic, and cultural governance has grown rapidly over the last 30 years. While this transition has occurred peacefully in many countries, it can—when not managed carefully— also create a space for contestation and conﬂ ict to emerge. At the same time, fast-emerging global trends are affecting the way people and societies operate and interact.

New technologies and automation are rapidly transforming industries, with the effect of reducing the need for unskilled or semiskilled labor in industries. Interconnectivity also enables transnational organized crime to ﬂ ourish, allows the rapid transmission of violent ideologies, and leaves economies vulnera- ble to cybercrime."}
{"page": 23, "text": "Executive Summary xxi Climate change, too, presents new chal- lenges, especially to poor and vulnerable countries and communities (Nordas and Gleditsch 2007). By itself, climate change does not cause violent conﬂ ict. However, it does create major stress, especially in fragile situa- tions where governments have limited means to help their populations adapt. Risks associ- ated with climate change can combine with and exacerbate risks of violence through fac- tors such as food insecurity, economic shocks, and migration (Marc, V erjee, and Mogaka 2015; Schleussner et al. 2016). This new global landscape features sig- niﬁ cant demographic shifts that may create new stresses, as well as opportunities, for global and national systems. Already there are more young people in the world than at any other time in history—1.8 billion peo- ple between the ages of 10 and 24—and the vast majority of young people live in low-income countries, many of them already affected by conﬂ ict (UN DESA 2015). In Africa, 60 percent of the popula- tion is under the age of 25 (UN DESA 2015). Harnessing the potential of a grow- ing young population is an important chal- lenge.

{"page": 23, "text": "hile a positive force for economies, also puts pressure on labor markets, which will have to absorb the estimated 600 million new workers entering the workforce in the next 10 years (ILO 2016). These demographic shifts are occur- ring against the backdrop of slow and uneven global economic growth. World trade value, merchandise exports, and commercial trade services all grew sub- stantially over the past 70 years, contrib- uting to consolidating peace in the aftermath of World War II. However, trade growth has been marked in recent years by downturns and a prolonged period of only modest improvement since the global ﬁ nancial crisis of 2007. In 2016, trade growth fell, for the ﬁ fth consecutive year, below 3 percent. Meanwhile, foreign direct investment has also been decreas- ing, adversely affecting growth and pro- ductivity (Hale and Xu 2016). These trends do not directly affect violent con- ﬂ ict; however, they do put additional stresses on systems and people and can increase the tendency for groups to mobi- lize for perceived grievances. The Pathways for Peace Framework Prevention is about creating incentives for actors to choose actions that resolve conﬂ ict without violence.

{"page": 23, "text": "An important corollary is that inclusive approaches to prevention should recognize and address group griev- ances early. Violence is highly path- dependent: once it takes hold, incentives and systems begin to reorient themselves in ways that sustain violence. Effective pre- vention requires acting before griev- ances harden and the threat of violence narrows the choices available for leaders and elites, understood as groups who hold power or inﬂ uence in a society. A society’s ability to manage conﬂ ict constructively is tested continuously by risks that push it toward violence and by opportunities to advance sustainable development and peace. T o help to visual- ize how these risks and opportunities act on and within a society, this book intro- duces the term “pathway” for the trajec- tory that every society shapes through the constant, dynamic interaction of its actors, institutions, and structural factors over time. As ﬁ gure ES.1 illustrates, a soci- ety encounters many dimensions and lev- els of risks and opportunities that affect its pathway.

This temporal aspect is important for international action. Development actors, for example, tend to decrease their engagement or withdraw altogether when risks escalate. Political actors tend to engage only when the risk of violence is high or violence is already present. Instead, viable, sustained action in support of preventing violence is needed throughout policies and programs."}
{"page": 24, "text": "xxii Executive Summary Why People Fight: Inequality, Exclusion, and Injustice Some of the greatest risks of violence today stem from the mobilization of perceptions of exclusion and injustice, rooted in inequalities across groups (Collier and Hoefﬂ er 2004; Cramer 2003; Fearon and Laitin 2003; Lichbach 1989; Østby 2013). When an aggrieved group assigns blame to others or to the state for its perceived eco- nomic, political, or social exclusion, then emotions, collective memories, frustration over unmet expectations, and a narrative that rouses a group to violence can all play a role in mobilization to violence (Cederman Wimmer, and Min 2010; Justino 2017; Nygård et al. 2017; Sargsyan 2017). People come together in social groups for a variety of subjective and objective reasons. They may share feelings, history, narratives of humiliation, frustrations, or identities that motivate them to collective action in different ways, at different times, and in different situations. Perceptions of inequality between groups often matter more in terms of mobilization than mea- sured inequality and exclusion (Rustad 2016; Stewart 2000, 2002, 2009). This pat- tern of exclusion includes inequality in the distribution of and access to political opportunity and power among groups, including access to the executive branch and the police and military.

{"page": 24, "text": "in the distribution of and access to political opportunity and power among groups, including access to the executive branch and the police and military. Political exclu- sion provides group leaders with the incen- tive to mobilize collective action to force (or negotiate) change. Exclusion that is enforced by state repression poses a grave risk of violent con- ﬂ ict (Bakker, Hill, and Moore 2016; Piazza 2017; Stewart 2002). Countries where gov- ernments violate human rights, especially the right to physical integrity, through practices such as torture, forced disappear- ances, political imprisonment, and extraju- dicial killings, are at a higher risk for violent conﬂ ict (Cingranelli et al. 2017). In these contexts, repression creates incentives for violence by reinforcing the perception that there is no viable alternative for expressing grievances and frustration. Societies that offer more opportunities for youth participation in the political and economic realms and provide routes for social mobility for youth tend to experi- ence less violence (Idris 2016; Paasonen and Urdal 2016). With the global youth popula- tion increasing, the ability to harness the energy and potential of youth presents a strong opportunity for this “unique demo- graphic dividend, ” as the 2015 United Nations Security Council Resolution 2250 notes (UN Security Council 2015).

Changes in women’s status or vulnerability, such as an increase in domestic violence or a reduction in girls’ school attendance, often are viewed as early warnings of social and political inse- curity (Hudson et al. 2012). Prevention of violent conﬂ ict requires a strong focus on women’s experiences and on measures to ensure their participation in political, social, and economic life. Some evidence suggests that when women take leadership roles and are able to participate meaningfully in peace negotiations, the resulting agreements tend to last longer and there is greater satisfaction with the outcomes (O’Reilly, Ó Súilleabháin, and Paffenholz 2015; Paffenholz et al. 2017; Stone 2015; UN Women 2015).

As the spaces where livelihoods and well-being are deﬁ ned and defended, access to these are- nas can become, quite literally, a matter of life or death. The arenas reﬂ ect the broader balance of power in society, and as such, they are highly contestable and often resis- tant to reform. Competition for power is an age-old source of conﬂ ict. Power balances and imbalances can put a society at risk of vio- lence. Experience shows that more inclu- sive and representative power- sharing arrangements lower the risk of violent conﬂ ict. Decentralizing, devolving, or allowing autonomy of subnational regions or groups can help to accommodate diver- sity and lower the risk of violence at the national level. Resources such as land, water, and extractives are traditional sources of friction. The effects of climate change, population growth, and urbanization are intensifying these risks. Disputes over resources have spilled over into violent conﬂ ict and instabil- ity across the world. Improving the sharing of resources and beneﬁ ts derived from them as well as strengthening local conﬂ ict resolution mechanisms are important areas of focus.

Service delivery does not have a direct relationship with violence, but it affects state legitimacy and the ability of the state to mediate conﬂ icts (Brinkerhoff, Wetterberg, and Dunn 2012; Sacks and Larizza 2012; Stel and Ndayiragiie 2014). The way in which services are delivered and the inclu- siveness and perceptions of fairness in ser- vice delivery matter as much as—perhaps more than—the quality of services delivered (Sturge et al. 2017). Security and justice institutions that operate fairly and in alignment with the rule of law are essential to preventing vio- lence and sustaining peace. Accountability of security forces to the citizen, stronger community policing approaches, and improved efﬁ ciency of redress mechanisms are among the responses often needed. What Works: How Countries Have Managed Contestation and Prevented Violent Conﬂ ict Drawing on the pathways framework, the study describes the experience of national actors in three key areas: shaping the incen- tives of actors for peace, reforming institu- tions to foster inclusion, and addressing structural factors that feed into grievances.

Overall, the studies suggest that effective prevention is a collec- tive endeavor—led domestically, built on existing strengths, and with international and regional support. 6 A central dilemma for all countries exam- ined is that the incentives for violence are often certain and speciﬁ c to an individual or group, while the incentives for peace are often uncertain, and diffuse (World Bank 2017).

The more successful cases mobilized a coalition of domestic actors to inﬂ uence incentives toward peace, bringing in the comparative advantages of civil society, including women’s groups, the faith com- munity, and the private sector to manage tensions. Decisive leadership provided incentives for peaceful contestation, not least by mobilizing narratives and appealing to norms and values that support peaceful resolution (World Bank 2011). 7 Nevertheless, before or after violence, countries that have found pathways to sus- tainable peace have eventually tackled the messy and contested process of institutional reform. Expanding access to the arenas of contestation has been key to increasing rep- resentation and alleviating grievances related to exclusion. Often, the transition moment that led to sustainable peace was based on a shift away from security-led responses and toward broader approaches that mobilized a range of sectors in support of institutional reforms.

In these experiences, the greatest chal- lenge lay not so much in accessing knowl- edge, but in the contentious process of identifying and prioritizing risks. Part of the reason for this difﬁ culty is that violence narrowed the options for forward-looking decision making needed to invest in institu- tional or structural conditions for sustain- able peace. Conﬂ ict did not bring a windfall of resources; instead it brought a move to equip and support police, military, or secu- rity operations that strained national budgets. Furthermore, preventive action was at times unpopular, with popular demands for visible and tangible security mea- sures trumping longer-term, more complex responses addressing the causes of violence. In these processes, formal political settle- ments, or at least durable settlements, have been important, but also rare events. In some cases, political settlements have been applied only to address speciﬁ c aspects of conﬂ ict, while underlying causes were targeted more comprehensively through government action.

A Global System for Prevention under Stress Since the end of the Cold War, the multilat- eral architecture for conﬂ ict prevention and postconﬂ ict peacebuilding has struggled to adapt to a fast-changing situation in the ﬁ eld and globally. Despite many challenges, there have been clear achievements. At a systemic level, comprehensive inter- national normative and legal frameworks are in place to regulate the tools and con- duct of war; protect human rights; address global threats including climate change, ter- rorism, and transnational criminal net- works; and promote inclusive approaches to development (the SDGs). Operationally, the United Nations and regional organizations such as the African Union and the European Union have pro- vided global and regional forums to coordi- nate international responses to threats to peace and stability. The result has been important tools—including preventive diplomacy, sanctions, and peacekeeping— that have proven instrumental in prevent- ing conﬂ icts, mediating cease-ﬁ res and peace agreements, and supporting postcon- ﬂ ict recovery and transition processes.

These conclusions increase the need to focus on the endogenous risk factors that engender violence and on support for countries to address their own crises. Building Inclusive Approaches for Prevention Prevention is a long-term process of rein- forcing and steering a society’s pathway toward peace. This study amassed over- whelming evidence that prevention requires sustained, inclusive, and targeted attention and action. Deep changes are needed in the way national, regional, and international actors operate and cooperate so that risks of violent conﬂ ict are identi- ﬁ ed and addressed before they translate into crisis. However, few incentives now exist for this coordination, collaboration, and cooperation. Instead, preventive action often focuses on managing the accompany- ing crisis rather than addressing underlying risks, even when solutions to the underly- ing risk are available. Pathways for Peace highlights three core principles of prevention. • Prevention must be sustained over the time needed to address structural issues comprehensively, strengthen institutions, and adapt incentives for actors to manage conﬂ ict without violence. It is easy, but wrong, to see prevention as a trade- off between the short and long term. Sustainable results require sustained investment in all risk environments, while development"}

Sustainable results require sustained investment in all risk environments, while development investments should be integrated into overarching strategies with politically viable short-term and medium-term actions. The need for sustainability requires balancing effort and resources so that action does not reward only crisis management. • Prevention must be inclusive and build broad partnerships across groups to identify and address grievances that fuel violence. T oo often, preventive action is focused on the demands of actors that control the means of violence and positions of power. In complex, fragmented, and protracted conﬂ icts, an inclusive approach to prevention puts an understanding of grievances and agency at the center of national and international engagement. It recognizes the importance of understanding people and their communities: their trust in institutions, conﬁ dence in the future, perceptions of risk, and experience of exclusion and injustice. • Prevention must proactively and directly target patterns of exclusion and institutional weaknesses that increase risk.

Modern conﬂ icts arise when groups contest access to power, resources, services, and security; alongside efforts to mitigate the impacts of violence and de-escalate conﬂ ict, preventive action must actively and directly target grievances and exclusion across key arenas of risk. Devising National Strategies for Prevention The state bears the primary responsibility for preventing conﬂ ict and shaping a coun- try’s pathway toward sustainable develop- ment and peace. The following are some recommendations for effective national action in partnering for prevention. Monitor the Risks of Conﬂ ict Engaging early in preventive action requires a shift from early warning of violence and toward awareness of risk: • Identify real and perceived exclusion and inequality, which requires strengthening the capacity for identifying, measuring, and monitoring SDG indicators 8 • Strengthen national early warning systems and design systems that can effectively inﬂ uence early response by national actors at various levels • Harness technology to improve monitoring, especially in remote and conﬂ ict-affected areas, including through application of ICT and real-time data collection methods • Ensure that surveys and data collection measure inequality, exclusion, and"}

Aligning Peace, Security, and Development for Prevention One of the objectives of Pathways for Peace is to stimulate new thinking about the relationship of development, peace, and security—a relationship that takes con- crete form in inclusive approaches to pre- venting conﬂ ict.

Each has comparative advantages at different stages of risk but sustained, inclu- sive, and targeted prevention requires that they coordinate more effectively. The fol- lowing are some recommendations for better alignment. Ensure that Security and Development Approaches Are Compatible and Mutually Supportive Mutual support requires rebalancing growth and stability targets, as aggrieved groups whose exclusion poses a conﬂ ict risk may not be the poorest and may not be in areas of high potential for economic growth. Where security interventions are warranted, social services and economic support should also be provided so that security forces are not the only interface between the state and the population. Build Capacity and Allocate Resources to Ensure that Grievances Are Mediated Quickly and T ransparently Capacity building can be addressed through training, development of guidance, and strengthening of institutions. Support for national and local-level mediation can be integrated into planning and programming at the local level (Rakotomalala 2017).

Inclusive prevention entails a focus on strengthening the capacity of the society, not just the state, for prevention. Inclusive prevention is a bottom-up process that should involve as broad a spectrum of people and groups as possible. Coalitions should reﬂ ect the importance of young people, women, the private sector, and civil society organizations. Adopt a People-Centered Approach A people-centered approach should include mainstreaming citizen engagement in development programs and local conﬂ ict resolution to empower underrepresented groups such as women and youth. Service delivery systems should seek to make peo- ple partners in the design and delivery of public services through mainstreaming par- ticipatory and consultative elements for all planning and programming in areas at risk of violent conﬂ ict.

Development orga- nizations should ensure that prevention has a higher priority in their programming. Share Risk Assessments In the absence of a coherent process to share data, many organizations carry out assessments of different risks using differ- ent indicators. These data mostly remain internal to these organizations and are not shared with the national government or other relevant national actors, mostly because this information is often seen as politically sensitive. Risk monitoring and assessment methodologies also must become more widely shared, with speciﬁ c focus on developing shared metrics across the various risks to development, peace, and security. Commit to Collective Mechanisms to Identify and Understand Risks at Regional, Country, and Subnational Levels The absence of effective mechanisms trans- lates into ad hoc and fragmented actions among international partners.

Build Stronger Regional and Global Partnerships Efforts should include the strengthening of regional analyses and strategies for preven- tion and the sharing of risk analyses to the extent possible at a regional level. Explore New Investment Approaches for Prevention Financing for prevention remains risk averse and focused on crises. As a result, current models are too slow to seize win- dows of opportunity and too volatile to sus- tain prevention. Complex and multilevel efforts are often constrained by the lack of needed and readily available resources, resulting in ad hoc resource mobilization attempts to generate ﬁ nancing from donors, often resulting in delayed and suboptimal responses.

Conclusion A comprehensive shift toward preventing violence and sustaining peace offers life- saving rewards. Pathways for Peace presents national and international actors an agenda for action to ensure that attention, efforts, and resources are focused on prevention. T oday, the consequences of failing to act together are alarmingly evident, and the call for urgent action has perhaps never been clearer. The time to act is now. Notes 1. UCDP (2017).

It covers the years 1946 to 2016. UCDP data that record nonstate and one-sided violence that results in at least 25 conﬂ ict-related deaths in a calendar year cover the years 1989 to 2016. 2.

National governments and other local actors are the foundation and point of reference for preventive action (see UN General Assembly 2016; UN Security Council 2016; Articles 2 and 3 of the United Nations Charter).

Several SDG targets and indicators could have relevance for assessing risks of horizontal inequality. Speciﬁ cally, key core targets include SDG5 (5.1: End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere); SDG10 (10.2: By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic, and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, eth- nicity, origin, religion, or economic or other status; 10.3: Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies, and practices and promoting appropriate legisla- tion, policies, and action in this regard); and SDG16 (16.3: Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all; 16.7: Ensure responsive, inclusive, partic"}

Implementing the monitoring of percep- tions and issues such as horizontal inequal- ity requires several important safeguards to be in place. Governments and other actors can use questions on perceptions, identity, and aspirations to identify certain groups, target them for security purposes, deny people’s rights, or support implementation of exclusionary policies. It is essential that very strong attention be given to protecting individual and collective rights of the popu- lation interviewed and the people collecting the information.

{"page": 37, "text": "Introduction 1 Introduction Violent conﬂ ict has surged in recent years.1 While this violence is concentrated in rela- tively few countries, its global impact is enormous. The spread of violence across previously stable regions, the increased use of terrorism as a tactic of war, and the deployment of remote tactics of warfare have exacted a terrible human toll. The global sense of security has been shaken far beyond any speciﬁ c battleﬁ eld. For the countries directly affected by civil war, the impact of violence is measured not only in direct casualties but also in economic col- lapse, breaking apart of institutions, and tearing of the social fabric. The impacts of violence also reverberate globally. The ﬂ ow of refugees from violent conﬂ ict has reached historic proportions. Attacks on civilian tar- gets have increased signiﬁ cantly. Peace and security policies are changing dramatically in reaction to new threats. 2 The majority of violent conﬂ icts play out within the border of the countries where they originate. Y et violence has become increasingly complex, crossing borders and becoming protracted and intractable. In today’s highly interconnected world, violent conﬂ ict can evolve rapidly, making tradi- tional preventive tools obsolete and ineffec- tive.

Many armed conﬂ icts today take place on the peripheries of states and do not directly involve government soldiers. Violence remains entrenched in low-income countries, yet some of today’s deadliest con- ﬂ icts are occurring in countries with higher income levels and stronger institutions. This suggests that economic development alone is not a guarantee of peace. Armed groups increasingly act across borders and beneﬁ t from cross-border illicit economies, triggering foreign intervention and under- mining regional stability. An impediment to development and prosperity today and in the future, violent conﬂ ict also curtails the ability of govern- ments to reduce poverty. By 2030—the horizon set by the international community for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—more than 60 percent of the world’s poor will live in countries affected by fragility and high levels of violence (OECD 2015; World Bank 2011). By the same year, the costs of humanitarian assis- tance will be a staggering US$50 billion per year (UN 2016). The growing costs associated with vio- lent conﬂ ict, the increasingly global impact of many contemporary conﬂ icts, and their resistance to established settlement mecha- nisms make focusing on prevention a prior- ity for the international community.

This study also builds on the ﬁ ndings of the World Development Report 2011: Conﬂ ict, Security, and Development (World Bank 2011). This study seeks to improve the way in which domestic development processes interact with security, diplomatic, justice, and human rights efforts to prevent con- ﬂ icts from becoming violent. It recognizes that the World Bank Group and the United Nations bring separate comparative advan- tages to the prevention of violent conﬂ ict and have different roles and responsibilities in the international architecture. Therefore, while a holistic framework is essential to prevention, the ﬁ ndings and recommenda- tions of this study do not apply to all orga- nizations in the same way. Prevention of Violent Conﬂ ict Works and Is Cost-Effective Prevention is a rational and cost-effective strategy for countries at risk of violence and for the international community. Beyond the moral value associated with saving human lives and preventing atrocity, pre- vention minimizes the costs of destruction generated by cycles of violence (Chang and Luo 2013).

{"page": 38, "text": "generated by cycles of violence (Chang and Luo 2013). By preserving a landscape free of large-scale armed violence, prevention also minimizes the indirect costs of vio- lence, such as the diversion of resources toward military expenditures, international spillovers to neighboring countries and regions, and losses of human capital (De Groot, Brück, and Bozzoli 2009). Given the characteristic persistence of violence once it starts and the likelihood of relapse, the beneﬁ ts of prevention accumulate over time (Mueller 2017). Several studies have developed method- ologies to estimate the cost-effectiveness of conﬂ ict prevention (Brown and Rosecrance 1999; Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conﬂ ict 1997; Chalmers 2007; IEP 2017; Mueller 2017). While the availability and quality of data remain a major issue, this recent body of literature provides evidence that the prevention of violent con- ﬂ ict is associated with enormous returns in terms of cost avoidance. These returns are particularly high for conﬂ ict-affected coun- tries, but are equally meaningful for the international community as well. Existing patterns of spending on ofﬁ cial develop- ment assistance and humanitarian aid— strongly focused on countries in or after conﬂ ict—suggest that the international community could save substantial resources by refocusing its efforts on preventing vio- lence.

{"page": 38, "text": "aid— strongly focused on countries in or after conﬂ ict—suggest that the international community could save substantial resources by refocusing its efforts on preventing vio- lence. The scholarly literature concurs that taking preventive action before the out- break of violence is considerably cheaper for the international community than inter- vening during or after violence occurs (Foreign and Commonwealth Ofﬁ ce 2003; Mueller 2017). In their early attempt to estimate the cost-effectiveness of prevention, Brown and Rosecrance (1999) demonstrate that in Haiti, Rwanda, and Somalia, among other situations, preventive action by the interna- tional community would have saved con- siderable resources later on. Looking at a series of case studies, Chalmers (2007) sim- ilarly estimates the cost-effectiveness ratio of prevention to lie somewhere between 1:2 and 1:7. These ﬁ gures suggest that, over the medium to long term, donors would save between US$2 and US$7 for each US$1 invested in prevention-related activities. The cost-effectiveness of prevention, how- ever, becomes even clearer if the actual costs to conﬂ ict-affected countries and their neighbors are considered. Looking at data from Rwanda between 1995 and 2014, the Institute for Economics and Peace ﬁ nds the cost-effectiveness ratio of peacebuilding to be 1:16.

An analysis carried out for this study by Mueller (2017) presents a series of scenarios in which the costs and beneﬁ ts of preven- tion are calculated considering different success rates of prevention efforts (see box I.1).

The expected returns on prevention will be positive as long as the costs of prevention are less than the damages or losses attributable to violence. Considering the highly destructive potential of war, this is almost always the case provided that prevention is minimally effective. The returns on prevention vary in optimistic, pessimistic, and neutral scenarios (table BI.1.1). The negative effects of war on economic growth and expenditures on postconﬂ ict aid and peacekeeping need to be weighed against the expected costs and efﬁ cacy of the three scenarios for prevention. The effects of prevention for each scenario are described in terms of economic damages, loss of life avoided (prevented damage), and cost savings in postconﬂ ict reconstruction and peacekeeping (saved costs). Prevention beneﬁ ts all actors involved: • Prevention is economically beneﬁ cial. Even in the most pessimistic scenario, the average net savings is close to US$5 billion per year. In the most optimistic scenario, the net savings is almost US$70 billion per year. • The bulk of the savings accrue at the national level, where direct costs of conﬂ ict in terms of casualties and forgone economic growth are greate"}
{"page": 39, "text": ", the net savings is almost US$70 billion per year. • The bulk of the savings accrue at the national level, where direct costs of conﬂ ict in terms of casualties and forgone economic growth are greatest. The lost growth from a year of conﬂ ict means that every subsequent year’s economic growth starts from a lower base, so prevention leads to compounded savings over time. • Prevention is also good for the international community. It saves on postconﬂ ict humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping interventions, which are much more expensive than preventive action itself. In the most optimistic scenario, yearly savings for the international community could amount to US$1.5 billion per year. In the most pessimistic scenario, yearly savings for the international community could amount to US$698 million. • The beneﬁ ts of prevention increase over time, while the costs fall. This means that the net savings (displayed in table BI.1.1) are much lower than the total beneﬁ ts reached after 15 years. The three scenarios are based on assumptions regarding lost gross domestic product (GDP) growth attributable to conﬂ ict (Lomborg 2013; Mueller 2017), the costs of prevention, and the effectiveness of prevention (Dunne 2012).

The pessimistic scenario, which uses the most conservative assumptions, assumes that prevention is rarely effective (25 percent of the time); the costs of prevention are very high (US$1 billion per intervention per year); and war affects GDP with lower growth of 2.5 percent per year. The neutral scenario uses assumptions between these two extremes: prevention is effective 50 percent of the time; it is moderately expensive (US$500 million per intervention per year); and GDP growth is 3.9 percent lower per year of active conﬂ ict. Returns on prevention may be even greater than the conservative estimates that this simple model suggests. This model does not factor in many additional costs of war that may make prevention even more cost-effective. Costs associated with forced displacement, for instance, are not included. Military expenditure to ﬁ ght civil wars, which is known to divert critical resources from productive activities in low-income countries (Collier and Hoefﬂ er 2006), is not included either.

Put another way, for each US$1 invested in prevention, about US$16 is saved down the road. Why, Then, Is There So Little Belief in the Prevention of Violent Conﬂ ict? The vast majority of countries manage con- ﬂ ict peacefully most of the time and can prevent its violent manifestations. Both individuals and societies tend to cooperate to avoid the risk of violence. Many coun- tries have established institutions for redistributive purposes, for security and justice, and for the management of political competition. These institutions support societies in resolving conﬂ ict peacefully and routinely provide effective governance (World Bank 2017), preventing conﬂ ict and tensions in society from turning violent.

This study analyzes cases of countries at high risk of violent conﬂ ict that have successfully prevented violence through a combination of effective policies, programs, and political action. While countries can be successful at reducing violence, the prevailing perception is that the international community’s ability to tackle the risk of violent conﬂ ict effec- tively has been declining. Pessimism perme- ates the tone of public discourse when it comes to preventing conﬂ ict. Stories of suc- cessful prevention rarely receive the same public attention as conﬂ icts that descend into violence. Prevention lacks positive publicity, as the existence of a direct link between speciﬁ c policy actions and the resulting absence of violence is often hard to prove. Economists refer to this problem as “lack of counterfactuals. ” How can the positive impact of preventing a violent con- ﬂ ict be credited, if that conﬂ ict did not occur? It is difﬁ cult to prove that speciﬁ c actions have addressed the high risk of vio- lent conﬂ icts. Many factors may be at play, and singling out speciﬁ c causes and effects is often impossible.

The drivers of violent conﬂ ict are complex and so is the identiﬁ cation of the courses of action needed to prevent violence and sus- tain peace. There is no single, simple for- mula for prevention. Preventing violent conﬂ ict and building peace call for different approaches in different circumstances and in different contexts. Redirecting invest- ments to a marginalized region, engaging youth in meaningful activities, investing in the education of women, and setting up grievance-redress mechanisms are all exam- ples of actions that can foster inclusiveness and reduce the risk of violent conﬂ ict. At times, such courses of action may appear banal. Often, they do not even register as prevention in the minds of common citi- zens and policy makers. Furthermore, effective preventive action requires justifying preemptive investments and allocating scarce resources to address risks before their potential impacts have become evident. It is part of human nature to hope, even in the face of clear risks, that the worst will be avoided. One may wonder, as a consequence, whether the political, eco- nomic, and social costs of early preventive actions are worth incurring.

It may take considerable effort to convince people that a healthy lifestyle is the most effective prescription for a long life and that tertiary care, with its sophisticated hospitals and technologies, can treat but not prevent illness. Finally, incentives for acting collectively to prevent a crisis are often weaker than those for mobilizing a response to crisis. Crises mobilize societies and government much more effectively than early action. Crisis exerts a powerful and self-reinforcing attraction. Societies can become gripped by a cycle where conﬂ ict—and the response to that conﬂ ict—dominates the attention of leaders and citizens. Policy becomes increas- ingly reactive, reducing space for preven- tion. Cycles of crisis-to-crisis, short-term emergency responses create their own self-reinforcing appeal. These three dilemmas of prevention hold at a global level. The international community has secured some degree of suc- cess in containing and ending conﬂ icts, but its focus has been more on short-term crisis management than on the upstream preven- tion of violence.

International action, deployed when a crisis is looming or when violence has escalated, is, arguably, over- whelming the capacity of the international system to respond. Development policies that could effec- tively address early risks of violence by promoting structural and institutional change are often designed with limited consideration given to prevention. Risks of violent conﬂ icts are rarely integrated in their design. Holistic and sustained approaches to maintaining peace and build- ing local resilience are rare. When they suc- ceed, they rarely attract attention. What Is the Prevention of Violent Conﬂ ict? The UN twin resolutions on sustaining peace deﬁ ne prevention as the avoidance of “the outbreak, escalation, recurrence, or continu- ation of violent conﬂ icts” (UN General Assembly 2016; UN Security Council 2016).

It is about building societ- ies that offer opportunities and are inclu- sive. In this sense, prevention is a long-term approach in its time horizon, as it requires sustained efforts over time. This study presents a framework (pre- sented in chapter 3) for conceptualizing how societies forge unique pathways as they navigate risks of violence and harness opportunities for peace. The longer, and more intentionally, a society has worked to foster incentives for peace, the harder it will be to derail progress. Violence, too, is path-dependent. Once it takes hold, incen- tives reconﬁ gure around the expectation that it will continue. Prevention, then, is not only about avoiding or stopping repeated violent crises. While it is necessary to avoid crisis by miti- gating the impact of shocks, prevention also requires proactively addressing deeper, underlying risks that prevent sustainable development and peace. In most conﬂ icts, these deeper risks create fertile ground for mobilization to violence.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are integrated and indivisible in nature. Efforts to achieve one goal are seen as instrumental to achieving other goals. For example, actions to address goals such as eradicating poverty (SDG 1), reducing inequalities (SDG 10), promoting quality education (SDG 4), achieving gender equality (SDG 5), addressing climate change (SDG 13), supporting peace and strengthening institutions (SDG 16), and promoting partnerships (SDG 17) can have mutually reinforcing effects.

International actors play a critical role in supporting endogenous preventive efforts. Their support is also instrumental in sus- taining regional efforts by neighbors that have an interest in avoiding violence, the negative effects of which could spill over into their own countries. Can Prevention of Violent Conﬂ ict Be Done Differently? This study is about the prevention of violent conﬂ ict. Conﬂ ict is an essential component of societal dynamics and an expression of human interaction. Negotiation among groups over important issues, such as access to power, natural resources, and security, is a form of management of conﬂ ict. The pro- cess of contestation can be healthy. Conﬂ ict often produces positive outcomes, as it brings about change. When conﬂ ict becomes violent, however, it imposes human and economic costs that can become enormous and can strip away incentives for peaceful conﬂ ict resolution. Violence and violent conﬂ ict have accompanied political, social, and economic change throughout history (Tilly 1990, 2003).

Y et humans have constantly strived to avoid violence, developing sophisticated institu- tions to respond to its risk (Pinker 2012). This deep contradiction is not likely to disappear any time soon. Under certain cir- cumstances, societies will always be tempted to resort to violence to achieve their goals. There is increasing recognition, however, that the human suffering and exorbitant costs associated with violent conﬂ ict can often be avoided, with positive change resulting from peaceful contestation. This study is clear-eyed in its recognition that absolute prevention of all conﬂ icts is beyond reach, if not impossible. T o be sure, it looks beyond reach in the present, complex global context. It, nonetheless, argues that states and the international community can do a much better job of addressing the risks of violent conﬂ icts and reducing their occurrence.

Funds for humanitarian assistance and postconﬂ ict reconstruction will always be easier to mobilize than those for long-term preventive efforts. They are tangible. They can be broadcasted on television and make the donor feel successful. They sell politically in the coun- try providing the funds. Effective, sustained prevention is not very interesting to watch on television. The Importance of Agency to Prevention Violence is the product of many factors. It is often difﬁ cult to attribute violence to a sin- gle root cause. Violence is like a fever in a human body: it can be caused by many dif- ferent illnesses. The question is not why societies have conﬂ ict, but why some groups choose violence to resolve their differences with other groups or with the state. This study argues that a signiﬁ cant proportion of contemporary violent conﬂ icts are rooted in group-based grievances around exclu- sion that forge deep-seated feelings of injustice and unfairness. Recent research supports this argument. Whether based on facts or perceptions, groups who feel excluded, relatively disadvantaged, or left out are much more likely to consider vio- lence to be an acceptable response than those who do not.

Identity plays an important role in this context, as cohesive groups with a shared sense of historical grievance are more likely to unite in response. This does not mean that every group with grievances will turn violent. In fact, the opposite is true. Nor does it mean that other factors such as external support, proliferation of weapons, and absence of deterrents are irrelevant."}
{"page": 44, "text": "8 Pathways for Peace On the contrary, they can and do play a crit- ical role. Group-based grievances, nonethe- less, are an important precursor to collective mobilization to violence. They need to be tackled head on and made a central compo- nent of prevention. This is why this study stresses the centrality of inclusion in pre- vention approaches. The accumulation of grievances around exclusion and how leaders and groups choose to deal with them largely determine whether a society steers a pathway toward violence or peace. Actors are constantly faced with choices, weighing responses to a variety of pressures and changes along their society’s pathway. Prevention, then, involves identifying and creating incentives for actors to make choices that lead to peaceful outcomes. Structural change and institu- tional reform within a society take time and require sustained investment. Actors in a society tend to behave and operate based on shorter timelines. They may need to show fast results, which prevention may not always provide. The need to balance actors’ short- and medium-term incentives with a long-term time horizon is thus one of the crucial challenges of prevention.

The result is a very complex situation that calls for a multifaceted approach to restoring peace. This study is divided into eight chapters. Chapter 1 describes the new proﬁ le of vio- lent conﬂ ict, which affects more countries, occurs more often within states and among a proliferation of armed groups, and increasingly involves foreign intervention.

Violent conﬂ ict is now occurring in middle-income countries as well as in both low-income coun- tries and fragile contexts, opening space for violent extremist groups and spilling over borders. This chapter surveys the state of violent conﬂ ict across several indicators, showing that, in recent years, more countries are affected by violent conﬂ ict, more armed groups are ﬁ ghting, and more outside actors are intervening. The chapter also examines trends beyond the numbers both to under- stand factors contributing to the new conﬂ ict dynamics and to adapt prevention policy on national, regional, and international levels. The cost of not preventing violent conﬂ ict is extremely high. Beyond its incalculable human cost, violent conﬂ ict reverses hard- won development gains, stunts the opportu- nities of children and young people, and robs economies of opportunities for growth.

Violent conﬂ ict and the humanitarian crises it spawns cost the world billions of dollars a year, out- pacing the capacity of states to respond. From roughly 1950 to 1990, parts of Africa and Asia experienced anti- and postcolonial violent conﬂ icts and superpower proxy wars over inﬂ uence and control of the state. The end of the Cold War brought a pause in the interstate tensions that characterized the bipolar international order. A window of opportunity opened to focus on intrastate conﬂ icts. Despite the escalation of some eth- nic conﬂ icts and prompted by the atrocities that took place in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, a surge in peacekeeping and pre- vention, among other factors, reduced violent conﬂ ict to unprecedented levels by the mid- 2000s (Human Security Report Project 2005; Pinker 2011). That more peaceful lull was broken in 2007, when violent conﬂ ict began to increase in scope and number of fatalities, particularly beginning in 2010. What makes people ﬁ ght and what they ﬁ ght over are not new, but the ﬁ ghting is hap- pening in a new context.

In a world where communications, ﬁ nance, crime, and ideas ﬂ ow across borders, many conﬂ icts have evolved into complex systems with interna- tional, regional, national, and communal links. Such conﬂ icts are resistant to resolu- tion through negotiated settlement, tending to play out in regions where other countries are already at risk of violent conﬂ ict (Walter 2017b). The proliferation of nonstate armed groups has also resulted in conﬂ icts with less state involvement, making them impervious to the settlement mechanisms deployed in the past. More external countries are inter- vening in violent conﬂ icts, which could present opportunities for mediation, yet also complicates conﬂ ict dynamics."}
{"page": 48, "text": "12 Pathways for Peace Violent Conﬂ ict in the T wenty-First Century Until recently, the world was becoming more peaceful (Pinker 2011). Following the end of the Cold War, the number and intensity 1 of most types of violent conﬂ ict steadily declined. That trend stalled in 2007 and has reversed since 2010. The incidence of violent conﬂ ict between states is still low (see box 1.1), but conﬂ ict within states—among a ballooning number of armed groups, between nonstate armed groups and the state, and increasingly involving some form of external intervention—is spreading. More countries were experiencing some form of violent conﬂ ict in 2016 than at any time in the previous 30 years (Allansson, Melander, and Themnér 2017; Gleditsch et al. 2002; Sundberg, Eck, and Kreutz 2012). While much of today’s violence is entrenched in low-income countries, neither wealth nor income renders countries immune. Some of the deadliest and seem- ingly most intractable conﬂ icts are occurring in middle-income countries, reversing hard- won human development gains. In addition, violence in various forms has reached epi- demic proportions in countries not consid- ered fragile (Geneva Declaration Secretariat 2015; OECD 2016).

{"page": 48, "text": "t 2015; OECD 2016). The highest rates of homicide and violent crime in the world are found in Latin America and the Caribbean, where urban gang violence and drug-related crime are features of everyday life. A few of these violent conﬂ icts—whether in low- or middle-income countries—produce the preponderance of fatalities, and most con- ﬂ icts are broadly concentrated in a few regions (Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia). BOX 1.1 The Decline of Violent Conflict between States Interstate violent conﬂ ict has been at historically low levels since the end of the Cold War. The Uppsala Conﬂ ict Data Program (UCDP) reported just two active interstate violent conﬂ icts in 2016, one between India and Pakistan and the other between Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 1987, ﬁ ve interstate wars were recorded, but since 1992, no more than two interstate wars were recorded in any given year, and several years experienced no such wars. The reasons for these low levels are varied. The end of the Cold War marked a shifting disposition of the great powers from conducting proxy warfare to preventing conﬂ icts around the world. Enhanced cooperation translated into a greater role for the United Nations (UN) Security Council as a mechanism for resolving disputes. In parallel, “International norms, legal regulations, and treaties [have created] a situation today where invasion and conquest are not only ou"}
{"page": 48, "text": "Security Council as a mechanism for resolving disputes. In parallel, “International norms, legal regulations, and treaties [have created] a situation today where invasion and conquest are not only outlawed, but also actively proscribed through deterrence” (Thompson 2014). Casualty avoidance has become a factor, with national leaders acutely sensitive to the perceptions of their domestic constituents and less willing to risk their soldiers’ lives or engage in warfare when it can be avoided. Today, outright military victory has become less feasible. Increasing economic interdependence may also contribute to the declining trend in interstate conﬂ ict because it creates mutual vulnerabilities that act as disincentives to going to war. In this calculus, “The opportunity costs of conﬂ ict greatly outweigh any potential economic gains” (Thompson 2014), which is one of the reasons why trade linkages between countries help to promote peace (Hegre, Oneal, and Russett 2010). The decline in interstate conﬂ ict does not mean that disagreements between states have disappeared. Real interstate tensions also persist, leaving open the possibility for a potentially devastating violent conﬂ ict to come.

T oday’s violent conﬂ icts are not con- ﬁ ned to national borders. Energized by regional and international links among groups, violent conﬂ icts often spill across borders or reﬂ ect the transnational aims and organization of such groups (OECD 2016, ch. 1). At the same time, countries are increasingly intervening in another coun- try’s conﬂ ict in support of a party or par- ties, giving these conﬂ icts an additional regional or international dimension. These new dynamics have signiﬁ cant implications for preventing violent conﬂ ict and building sustainable peace. Number of Violent Conﬂ icts within States The number of internal state-based conflicts—involving state and nonstate forces within the boundaries of a state— has risen sharply. 2 After peaking at 50 in 1991, the number of these conflicts declined for some years but then shot up again. In 2016, 47 internal state-based violent conflicts were recorded—the second-highest number in the post– Cold War era after 2015, when UCDP recorded 51 violent state-based conflicts (Allansson, Melander, and Themnér 2017; Gleditsch et al. 2002; see figure 1.1). 3 The number of conflicts that reach the thresh- old of war, resulting in at l"}

A few conﬂ icts are largely responsi- ble for the overall increase and result in the greatest proportion of battle-related deaths; the three deadliest countries in 2016 (Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria) incurred more than 76 percent of all fatalities recorded that year (Sundberg and Melander 2013; Croicu and Sundberg 2017; also see ﬁ gure 1.3).

Yet data sets—for example, the Uppsala Conﬂ ict Data Program (UCDP)—often lump all nonstate groups into a single category. Such armed groups are increasingly diverse and have varied goals. Putting all of them into one overarching category— one that includes rebel groups seeking to overthrow a state, armed trafﬁ cking groups, violent extremist groups with goals beyond the overthrow of a single state, and militias doing the bidding of elites yet not seeking formal state power, among others—conﬂ ates these groups. These groups exhibit different patterns of conﬂ ict as a result of their diverse goals, capacities, incentives, and other factors. The Armed Conﬂ ict Location and Event Data (ACLED) project makes some distinctions among nonstate armed groups. Data sets are organized according to the perpetrator of violence, and the perpetrator is not always evident. When a perpetrator is not or cannot be identiﬁ ed, the violence often goes unrecorded, and the data may depict a region as nonviolent when in fact it is very violent.

Their interplay contributes to the intractability of the Syrian conﬂ ict and overall instability in the region. Violent conflict between nonstate armed groups does not indicate the strength or weakness of such groups, nor does it preclude indirect state involvement. Progovernment militias, for example, fall under the umbrella of nonstate actors, as governments recruit militias to carry out violence on their behalf. 9 Communities or powerful actors (for example, gangs and drug cartels) may also create militias or armed groups when state security forces are absent or to protect their trade routes or control territory. These groups can be used to carry out violence on behalf of a regime seeking to distance itself from particularly shameful acts; militia violence may even be used to exercise inﬂ uence in competitive democratic contexts, aggravating grievances and exacerbating local and subnational conﬂ icts (Alvarez 2006; Raleigh 2016; Ron 2002).

Many of today’s armed actors operate in areas where state presence is too limited and fragmented or diffuse for traditional, leader-based approaches to negotiated political solutions to be effective (Raleigh and Dowd 2013). Some groups may explicitly reject international humani- tarian law as well as the international insti- tutions established to uphold it, placing themselves outside the ambit of traditional peacemaking processes (Walter 2017b). Many groups thrive in environments of weak rule of law or proﬁ t from illicit economies; they have little incentive to end violence. More external actors are intervening more often. Proxy wars with international- ized involvement from the Soviet Union or the United States were commonplace during the Cold War. T oday, emerging pow- ers are also intervening in violent conﬂ icts in pursuit of regional or strategic interests. In 2016, 18 violent conﬂ icts were interna- tionalized, 10 more than reported in any year since the end of World War II and second only to 2015, when 20 conﬂ icts were inter- nationalized (Allansson, Melander, and Themnér 2017; Gleditsch et al. 2002; see ﬁ gure 1.5).

Especially in cases where conﬂ icts are coded as full campaigns of violence that can last years, it can be difﬁ cult to capture these shifts and nuances accurately—resulting in a much simpler view of a very complex context. As conﬂ icts adapt, data sets should adapt and anticipate their complexity. The structure of data sets today corresponds to the dynamics of conﬂ icts in previous eras. While many of these data sets have been reﬁ ned over the years to respond to new needs and contexts, they should continue to adapt. Not all data sets code conflicts as full campaigns of violence.

In the con- text of Syria, for example, private funding complicates the dynamics of the conﬂ ict and any potential settlement. Engagement by outsiders, however, does not necessarily have a negative impact. According to Walter (2017a, 3), “Outside intervention that occurs after a peace treaty has been signed has a strong positive effect on the successful resolution of these [vio- lent conﬂ icts]. . . . External intervention also tends to have a positive effect on reducing the risks of an additional [violent conﬂ ict] once the ﬁ rst [violent conﬂ ict] has ended” (see also Doyle and Sambanis 2000; Fortna 2002). In cases where an outside state or international organization has been willing to enforce or verify the terms of a peace treaty, “negotiations almost always lead to peace”; when external actors do not do so, “negotiations almost always result in renewed [conﬂ ict]” (Walter 2017a, 1). 11 Violent conﬂ icts have become more pro- tracted and more difﬁ cult to resolve, with many violent conﬂ icts relapsing.

The Peace Research Institute Oslo reports that, since the mid-1990s, most conﬂ icts have been recurrences of old conﬂ icts rather than new conﬂ icts (Gates, Nygård, and Trappeniers 2016). On average, peace lasts only seven years after a conﬂ ict ends. In the post–World War II era, 135 countries experienced the recurrence of conﬂ ict, with 60 percent of all conﬂ icts recurring (Gates, Nygård, and Trappeniers 2016). In many violent conﬂ icts, gray zones appear, where a conﬂ ict becomes less intense, yet is not fully resolved (National Intelligence Council 2017). The average duration of violent conﬂ icts involving state forces has been trending upward since 1971. Violent conﬂ icts involv- ing state forces that ended in 2014 lasted, on average, 26.7 years, and those that ended in 2015 lasted, on average, 14.5 years. 12 By comparison, conﬂ icts that ended in 1970 lasted, on average, 9.6 years (Allansson, Melander, and Themnér 2017; Gleditsch et al. 2002; see ﬁ gure 1.6).

Understanding T rends in Violent Conﬂ ict The regional concentration of violent con- ﬂ ict is shifting. Most violent conﬂ icts today are occurring in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia (see ﬁ gure 1.7); the number of violent conﬂ icts in other parts of Asia and Europe, previously epicenters of conﬂ ict, has been decreasing (Allansson, Melander, and Themnér 2017; Gleditsch et al. 2002; Sundberg, Eck, and Kreutz 2012). In 2016, more than 24 percent of all violent conﬂ icts occurred in the Middle East, an increase from 2010, when the region experi- enced less than 11 percent of the total. These trends are predicted to continue (National Intelligence Council 2017). There are variations, however, in the kind of violent conﬂ ict that is most prevalent in a region. Conﬂ icts between nonstate actors represented more than 63 percent of the violent conﬂ icts in Africa in 2016 (33 vio- lent conﬂ icts).

Conﬂ ict between nonstate actors is also the primary form of violent conﬂ ict occurring in the Middle East and in the Americas, 14 where it makes up more than 63 percent (17 violent conﬂ icts) and 80 percent (8 violent conﬂ icts) of all violent conﬂ icts in the region, respectively (Sundberg, Eck, and Kreutz 2012; Allansson, Melander, and Themnér 2017). Subnational conﬂ ict, or “violent contes- tation aimed at securing greater political autonomy [often] for an ethnic minority group” (Colletta and Oppenheim 2017, 1), affects nearly every part of the world, but some regions more than others. It is the most common form of violent conﬂ ict in Asia, yet it has also been on the rise in Europe, the Middle East, and in recent years in Sub-Saharan Africa. Between 2000 and 2015, subnational conﬂ ict affected 24 coun- tries, resulting in more than 100,000 battle- related deaths in the period.

{"page": 56, "text": "20 Pathways for Peace Each of the many varieties of conﬂ ict in the world today has different implications for prevention approaches. Some of the deadliest conﬂ icts are over control of the central state or over internal power arrange- ments, as in Iraq, South Sudan, and Syria. 15 Protracted subregional conﬂ icts might not disrupt the functionality of the central state in most of its territory—as in Myanmar, the Philippines, and Thailand, among others— yet these conﬂ icts still have an impact on the operation of the state (Parks, Colletta, and Oppenheim 2013). Moreover, a large number of intercommunal conﬂ icts over extractive or natural resources or land can ﬂ are up before declining in intensity. Other events of political violence may occur around electoral periods, such as in Jamaica and Kenya (Malik 2017).

Arab countries are home to only 5 percent of the world’s population, but in 2014 they accounted for 45 percent of the world’s terrorist incidents, 68 percent of its battle- related deaths, 16 47 percent of its internally displaced population, and 58 percent of its refugees (UNDP 2016a). The United Nations Development Programme’s Arab Human Development Report 2016 predicts that by 2020, “Almost three out of four Arabs could be living in countries vulnerable to violent conﬂ ict” (UNDP 2016a). The violent conﬂ icts emerging after the Arab Spring—in Libya, Syria, and the Republic of Y emen, in particular— originated in domestic unrest inﬂ uenced by the regional upheavals of 2011. These con- ﬂ icts quickly drew in regional and global powers, which may “inﬂ uence or support— but rarely fully control—those ﬁ ghting on the ground” (Guéhenno 2016).

One of the factors contributing to the Arab Spring of 2011 and to the destabiliza- tion of long-standing Arab autocracies was the broken social contract between govern- ments and citizens (T oska 2017). Challenges to state legitimacy across the region also played an important role and emanated from shortcomings in economic opportu- nity, social mobility, democracy, rule of law, human rights, and gender equality. The social contract between several Arab gov- ernments and citizens that had persisted since independence consisted of the state providing public sector jobs, free education and health care, and subsidized food and fuel. In return, citizens were expected to keep their voices low and to tolerate some level of elite capture in the private sector (Devarajan and Ianchovichina 2017). This mechanism became less and less sustainable starting in the 2000s, as persistent ﬁ scal imbalances undermined the ability of gov- ernments to keep their part of the social bargain.

Once mass protests sparked the political transition in Tunisia, contagion to the rest of the region was quick, enabled by technology and a common language and rooted in economic problems and popular grievances that were common through- out the Middle East and North Africa (Ianchovichina 2017). 17 Worsening polarization between groups recurred across different contexts, whether between Islamists and their opponents in the Arab Republic of Egypt and Tunisia; politicization of cross-sectarian divides involving Sunnis and Shi’ites in Iraq 18 and some of the Gulf states; or tribal and local forces in Libya and the Republic of Y emen (Lynch 2016, 37). The lack of institutional conﬁ dence and the failure to secure a predictable transition toward new stable institutions further exacerbated social and political polarization. External interven- tions stoking sectarian or ethnic hatred inﬂ amed intergroup polarization. Countries that managed to stay peace- ful distinguished themselves from those that were affected by violence in terms of the quality of governance institutions, the ability to use redistribution to address grievances, and the presence or absence of external military interference (Devarajan and Ianchovichina 2017).

Indeed, the growing reach of violent extremist groups in recent years “is more a product of instability than its primary driver” (ICG 2016a). They differ from their predecessors in at least three ways (World Bank 2015). First, some of today’s violent extremist groups have greater global appeal than violent extremist groups of earlier times. Some are adept at connecting very local grievances—frustration with a discrimina- tory or predatory state, for example—with a global identity that posits youth as heroes in ostensibly a movement for global justice. Such groups harness technology to promote their narrative and recruit globally in ways that are often far ahead of state efforts to rein them in (World Bank 2015). Second, many of today’s violent extrem- ist groups form strategic alliances with dif- ferent groups in the areas in which they operate. This engagement can take different forms.

There have always been some true believers, some who join for material or political gain, and others who condone such groups but do not actively participate. However, today’s violent extremist groups are taking advantage of local divisions among groups and building opportunistic alliances to an unprecedented degree (ICG 2016a). Third, some violent extremist groups today have been able to use transnational networks to facilitate ﬁ nancing. This includes mobilizing ﬁ nancing from states and private donors to an unprecedented level. For example, oil revenue has contrib- uted a great deal of ﬁ nancing for the Islamic State (Heibner et al. 2017). Drug trafﬁ cking has been an important resource for both insurgent and extremist groups in Afghanistan and northern Mali (Comolli 2017). Extracting rents in exchange for pro- viding protection to many other types of trafﬁ cking networks—in particular, human trafﬁ cking networks—has also been a source of income. Finally, ransom and hos- tage taking have been a source of revenue for some groups.

For example, groups like Al Shabaab, Boko Haram, and the Islamic State claim to be recreating a caliphate with some of the elements of state structure. Looking for territorial control, these groups make much stronger efforts to connect with local communities, who at times support them out of fear or economic opportunity (ICG 2016a). 20 This suggests that focusing solely on the recruitment of violent extrem- ist groups is shortsighted. 21 Overall, “pre- venting crises will do more to contain violent extremists than countering vio- lent extremism will do to prevent crises” (ICG 2016a, v). Violent Conﬂ ict in the Midst of Rapid T ransformation in Sub-Saharan Africa Violent conﬂ ict in Sub-Saharan Africa has increased against the backdrop of the conti- nent’s fast-paced economic and political changes (Williams 2017). Poverty, and to some extent inequality, is decreasing, and economic growth has enabled several coun- tries to graduate to middle-income status (Beegle et al. 2016).

Conﬂ ict around weak political settle- ments in the region and power contestation is clearly exempliﬁ ed by the dramatic devel- opments in South Sudan.

By March 2016, at least 50,000 people had reportedly been killed (Reuters 2016), and millions of people had been forc- ibly displaced both as refugees and as inter- nally displaced persons (IDPs). 22 Since South Sudan’s independence in 2011, enormous challenges have constrained the effort of building institutions. The absence of legiti- mate political institutions beyond liberation politics, which was masked during the years of the common struggle against the Sudanese central government—combined with the lack of a security apparatus apart from the rebel movements that had led the ﬁ ght for independence—was at the origin of the outbreak of the conﬂ ict (ICG 2016b). Mali and Nigeria are two examples of identity-based conﬂ icts that have turned into violent extremist insurrections, as seen in other parts of the world. These conﬂ icts grew out of tensions that had little to do with ideology and were built up over time. For example, the Boko Haram insurrection in northern Nigeria, which started in the 1990s, developed slowly, building on a sen- timent of marginalization fueled by large inequalities between regions that left the population of the poorest state (Borno) feeling excluded from the country’s over- all relative prosperity (Comoll"}

Similarly, the spread of violent extremism in northern Mali in 2012 started as a nation- alist Tuareg rebellion, a recurrent phenome- non since colonial times, that turned into a violent extremist insurrection involving Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, Harakat Ansar Al-Dine, and others (ICG 2015). The high level of violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo is a clear illustration of intercommunal conﬂ ict con- nected to the absence of a positive state presence. In this region, many forms of con- ﬂ ict overlap. External inﬂ uence has played a role in sustaining violent conﬂ ict in the region. Y et eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced a relentlessly high number of both battle and other deaths and a particularly high number of civilian casualties, coupled with the use of conﬂ ict- related sexual violence as a weapon of war since the 1990s (Stearn 2011; UN 2017).

In addition to these three factors, other rising trends include the following. The tactics of violence are evolving . The number of weapons in circulation around the world has dramatically increased since the beginning of the twenty-ﬁ rst century (Pavesi 2016). The Small Arms Survey reports that an estimated 875 million small arms are in circulation worldwide. This is certainly a conservative estimate, given that accurate assessments are difﬁ cult. From 2001 to 2011, the value of the trade in small arms and light weapons nearly doubled globally, from $2.38 billion to $4.634 billion (Small Arms Survey 2014). From 2012 to 2013 the global small arms trade rose to US$6 billion—an increase of US$1 billion, or 17 percent, in a single year (Dutt 2016). Remote violence tactics are also becoming increasingly common and deadlier in conﬂ ict zones around the world.

This tactic also ﬁ ts into a strategy of groups resort- ing to so-called ‘weapons of the weak’ after losing territory and inﬂ uence, ” or being in an objective disadvantageous position compared to state forces (Kishi, Raleigh, and Linke 2016, 30; see also McCormick and Giordano 2007; Merari 1993; and Denselow 2010).

Violence that may stem from these exchanges is therefore at least indirectly linked to larger ongoing conﬂ icts, can result in the destabilization of the state, and can contribute to cycles of persistent violence.

These numbers were even higher in 2014, driven largely by attacks carried out by Boko Haram and the Islamic State (Eck and Hultman 2007; Allansson, Melander, and Themnér 2017). In some instances, nonstate actors may have an incentive to target civilians—for example, “as a cheaper strategy of imposing costs on the adversary”—especially at times when a settlement may be imminent (Hultman 2010). 27 States are also responsible for high rates of civilian deaths, although they may often “contract” this violence out to militias (Raleigh 2012).

At least 400,000 persons have been killed, about 5 million have ﬂ ed the country, and, according to the United Nations Ofﬁ ce for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 6.3 million have been internally displaced. Many of the individuals remaining in the country cannot access the help they need, as more than 50 percent of hospitals have been partially or completely destroyed, and the supply of doctors, nurses, and medical supplies is woefully inadequate (UNICEF 2015; UNOCHA 2017; World Bank 2017a). Children have been intensely affected: the United Nations Children’s Fund reports more than 1,500 grave human rights violations against children in 2015 alone, of which more than one-third occurred while children were in or on their way to school (UNICEF 2015). The proportion of children under 15 being recruited by armed groups increased from 20 percent in 2014 to more than 50 percent in 2015, and there has been an alarming increase in child marriage: a 2017 United Nations Population Fund survey estimates that the number of child brides (under 18 years of age) in Syria has quadrupled since the war began (UNFPA 2017).

Women have taken on a large burden not only of dealing with the impacts of conﬂ ict—caring for injured or orphaned family members—but also of providing humanitarian assistance and participating in processes to resist and transform the conﬂ ict. The economic impacts of the conﬂ ict are enormous. In real terms, Syria’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted an estimated 63 percent between 2011 and 2016. In cumulative terms, the loss in GDP amounted to an estimated US$226 billion between 2011 and 2016—approximately four times the country’s 2010 GDP. According to the World Bank, even if the conﬂ ict ends this year, the cumulative losses in GDP will reach 7.6 times the preconﬂ ict GDP by the twentieth year after the beginning of the conﬂ ict. If the conﬂ ict continues, this loss will stand at 13.2 times the country’s preconﬂ ict GDP (World Bank 2017a). The impacts of the conﬂ ict have spread to neighboring countries, which feel the brunt of the crisis acutely. Jordan, for example, has registered 654,903 Syrian refugees, while Lebanon has registered 997,905 (as of December 2017; UNHCR 2017).

Much of the violence occurs in urban areas and often targets civilian spaces, including those considered sanctuaries under international humanitarian law, such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship (ICRC 2017). 28 This impact is facilitated by the increasing use of “remote violence” 29 both in civil wars and in acts of terrorism in countries far from conﬂ ict. In addition to the doubling of the number of civilian deaths in violent conﬂ icts between 2010 and 2016, many more civilian deaths result from the indirect effects of conﬂ ict, such as unmet medical needs, food insecu- rity, inadequate shelter, or contamina- tion of water (Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development 2011; UNESCWA 2017). Vulnerable populations, such as children, are at particularly high risk (Economist 2015; Guha-Sapir and van Panhuis 2004).

Conﬂ ict can affect food security by decreasing production and diminishing access to land (Seddon and Adhikari 2003). Food insecurity can result in deaths from starvation and malnourishment. Conﬂ ict can damage health infrastructure within a country, leaving a population vulnerable to future health pandemics, as was the case in Liberia. Deaths can also result at or before birth.

Using battleﬁ eld deaths to quantify conﬂ ict can reinforce a gender bias in measuring violent conﬂ icts. “From a gender perspective, quantifying armed conﬂ ict on the basis of battle- related deaths is biased towards men’s experiences of armed conﬂ ict to the detriment of those of women and girls. While more men tend to get killed on the battleﬁ eld, women and children are often disproportionately targeted with other forms of potentially lethal violence during conﬂ ict” (Bastick, Grimm, and Kunz 2007).

It is important to note that “when children are targeted or killed, it is often in an attempt to instill terror in populations or to reaffirm bru- tality and gain (global) notoriety, given that the targeting of children is meant to send a message to (adult) adversaries and/ or the international community at-large. In addition to attacks, there are also numerous instances in which children are abducted and forced to fight in violent conflict” (Kishi 2015; see also Economist 2015; SOS Children’s Village 2015). The deliberate targeting of civilians over- all may be creating a perverse corollary. It is becoming more accepted that civilians in conflict zones are an inevitable part of violent conflict casualties.

Conﬂ ict, Famine, and Displacement Violent conﬂ ict scatters populations and disrupts livelihoods. Conﬂ ict, famine, and displacement are deeply interrelated (see box 1.6). Famine and food crises further contribute to the involuntary mass move- ment of people, especially in cases where violent conﬂ ict, mismanagement, and insuf- ﬁ cient responses to previous disasters have exacerbated the negative impact of a food crisis (Raleigh 2017). Violent conﬂ ict dis- rupts trade routes and markets for food and other necessities, causing further direct and indirect costs.

The number of refugees nearly doubled over the same period, with the majority (55 percent) of ref- ugees coming from just three countries: Afghanistan, South Sudan, and Syria (UNHCR 2017). More than half of the world’s refugees are children, many of whom have been separated from family (UNHCR 2017). Extreme poverty is now increasingly concentrated in vulnerable groups dis- placed by violent conﬂ ict, and the presence of these populations can affect develop- ment prospects in the communities hosting them (World Bank 2016a).

Drought destroys agricultural output, and violent conﬂ ict disrupts agriculture and trade of food crops between areas of surplus and deﬁ cit. The Global Report on Food Crises 2017 reports that in 2016, violent conﬂ ict and civil insecurity left more than 63 million people acutely food insecure and in need of urgent humanitarian assistance in 13 countries (Food Security Information Network 2017). Food insecurity can increase the risk of conﬂ ict, particularly when caused by rising food prices, by displacing populations, by exacerbating grievances, and by increasing competition for scarce food and water resources. Internally displaced persons and refugees often rely on host communities, placing a strain on already-scarce resources and heightening the risk for tension.

For each added percentage point in undernourishment, the likelihood for violent conﬂ ict increases by 0.24 percent per 1,000 population. Famine and food insecurity particularly affect rural and agriculture-based workers, women, and children, partly because social safety nets might be more prevalent. In addition to short-term suffering, famine victims are more likely to experience serious health problems and have signiﬁ cantly worse ﬁ nancial prospects over the long term. Modern famines are largely man- made and avoidable. In fragile contexts, alleviating poverty, strengthening social safety nets, and preventing violent conﬂ ict lower the risk of famine and food insecurity. Long-term stability also increases these states’ chances of weathering shocks that potentially cause famines.

Girls’ mobility is often highly restricted, limiting their access to school, employment, and other opportuni- ties, and this can be exacerbated during and after violent conﬂ ict (UN Women 2015). Intimate partner violence—whose victims are more often women—can also be linked to violent conﬂ ict more largely (see box 1.8). The Lifetime Impacts of Violent Conﬂ ict Exposure to conﬂ ict can generate impacts all along the life cycle. As illustrated in box 1.9, living in a setting where violence is present can have myriad impacts, some of which continue to manifest throughout the life cycle. These impacts can be generated both by the direct exposure to violence or by the witnessing of violence. For children and youth, the long-term effects of expo- sure to violence, combined with the adver- sities of daily life in a high-violence context, are associated with a range of chal- lenges (Miller and Rasmussen 2010). These include increased risk of perpetrating or being a victim of violence later in life (Child Trends 2017; Finkelhor et al. 2009; Margolin and Elana 2004) as well as negative effects on cognitive and social development (Betancourt et al. 2012; Blatt"}

The experience of traumatic events can lead to serious mental health and behav- ioral problems that hinder people’s ability to function in life. The World Bank has found that 30–70 percent of people who have lived in conﬂ ict zones suffer from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disor- der and depression (CDC 2014; Murthy and Lakshminarayana 2006; World Bank 2016b). Children who are orphaned or sep- arated from family often experience pres- sure to provide for themselves or become heads of households, which can make them vulnerable to exploitation by trafﬁ cking networks or armed groups (World Vision International 2017). The impacts on human capital can extend over generations (Mueller and T obias 2016). The harmful effects of violent conﬂ ict are especially insidious for children’s poten- tial development.

In a comparative study looking at cross- sectional variation in self-reported intimate partner violence before and after conﬂ ict in three Sub-Saharan African countries (Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, and Liberia), Kelly (2017) ﬁ nds that, despite differences in the nature of violent conﬂ ict in each country, there is a signiﬁ cant relationship between intimate partner violence and previous violent conﬂ ict in all three countries.

The rise in violent conﬂ ict in the Middle East, for example, has interrupted critical investments in the development of human capital. Children exposed to conﬂ ict will carry the effects of conﬂ ict throughout their lives, as the destruction of family assets has devastating long-term consequences on future possibilities and the destruction of education halts critical interventions designed to enhance the opportunities of individuals and improve society.

In Liberia, 354 of 550 medical facilities were destroyed during the Liberian Civil War, affecting how it coped with the Ebola epidemic (Murphy and Ricks 2014). In the Democratic Republic of Congo, vio- lent conﬂ ict worsened pregnancy outcomes (Ahuka, Chabikuli, and Ogunbanjo 2004). Conﬂ ict can also exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases. For example, the onset of recent conﬂ ict has resulted in a resur- gence of polio in Syria, a disease that had been nearly eradicated worldwide (Tajaldin et al. 2015). The World Health Organization has called the recent cholera outbreak in the Republic of Y emen “unprecedented” due to its quick appearance in the conﬂ ict zone (Al Jazeera 2017). Tuberculosis is also a major health problem, and conﬂ ict-affected countries have lower capacity to run tuber- culosis control programs (Waldman 2001). The Economic Costs of Violent Conﬂ ict The economic costs of violent conﬂ ict are staggering.

The Institute for Economics and Peace states in a 2016 report that the cost of con- taining violence is US$13.6 trillion a year globally, a ﬁ gure “equivalent to 13.3 [percent] of world GDP or US$1,876 PPP [purchas- ing power parity] per annum, per person. 33 T o further break it down, that ﬁ gure is US$5 per person, per day, every day of the year.

The adverse economic cost of violent conﬂ ict increases with the length of expo- sure to violence; with the duration of con- ﬂ icts increasing over time, these economic costs will have an increasingly adverse effect on affected countries and their futures (Röther et al. 2016). Beyond the impacts on countries at the macro-level, violent con- ﬂ ict also has economic impacts at the micro-level; loss of livelihoods and assets of households are essential in understanding the dynamics of conﬂ ict traps. Violent conﬂ ict is a major cause of the reversals in economic growth that many low- and middle-income countries have experienced in recent decades. Indeed, recessions experienced during periods of violent conﬂ ict in fragile countries are a key reason for much lower average growth rates over time (Mueller and T obias 2016). The consequences are hugely negative for fragile contexts. Afghanistan’s per capita income, for example, has barely changed since 1970 as the result of multiple violent conﬂ icts, while Somalia’s per capita income dropped by more than 40 percent in the same period (IEP 2015).

The impacts on the overall economy can be substantial. Mavriqi (2016) ﬁ nds that countries experiencing violent conﬂ ict suf- fer a reduction in annual GDP growth of 2–4 percent and up to 8.4 percent if the conﬂ ict is severe. Violent conﬂ ict is also associated with an acceleration of inﬂ ation; on average, the consumer price index increases by 1.6 percentage points during years of violent conﬂ ict (Röther et al. 2016). Economic growth can be severely affected in countries relying on trade or natural resources, if these resources are destroyed during conﬂ ict; a country relying on tour- ism may lose or have limited growth in that potential source of income as a result of violent conﬂ ict. Political, social, and economic risks are rife in postconﬂ ict periods. Postconﬂ ict economies often exist in power vacuums that allow organized crime to ﬂ ourish and create black market economies, which can include both drug and human trafﬁ cking.

A principal reason is that trust and capacity must ﬁ rst be built up before new institutions can succeed in fragile situations (Chen, Ravallion, and Sangraula 2008; World Bank 2011). Mueller and T obias (2016) ﬁ nd that countries with a history of intrastate conﬂ ict collect a smaller share of taxes relative to GDP than coun- tries that have not experienced violent con- ﬂ ict, which can make rebuilding after a conﬂ ict that much more difﬁ cult. Societies also pay the costs of conﬂ ict in their security structures. Military costs, especially for large armies, can be very high (Nordhaus 2002), hurting opportunity costs in particular. When resources are diverted toward security costs, states may forgo opportunities to invest in other sec- tors, such as manufacturing, clean energy, or increasing access to social services like education (Garrett-Peltier 2014). Violent conﬂ ict usually exacts a very high toll on infrastructure and production systems (Mueller and T obias 2016).

Neighboring countries often shoulder the burden of spillover effects from violent conﬂ ict. On average, countries that border a high-intensity conﬂ ict zone experience an annual decline of 1.4 percentage points in their GDP and an acceleration in inﬂ ation of 1.7 percentage points (Röther et al. 2016). In the Middle East, the conﬂ icts in Iraq and Syria are associated with a drop in economic growth of 1 percentage point in Jordan in 2013. Similar dynamics were at work in Lebanon, where GDP growth slowed from 2.8 percent in 2012 and 2.6 percent in 2013 from an average of 9.2 percent in 2007–10.

So-called “traditional” peacekeeping missions involving observational tasks performed by military personnel have evolved into what the United Nations Capstone Doctrine referred to as complex “multidimensional” enterprises (United Nations 2008). As of mid-2017, 16 peacekeeping operations were deployed and operational, while the number of police and military personnel in missions had nearly tripled from 34,000 in 2000 to 94,000 in August 2017. 37 By 2016, the total cost of maintaining peacekeeping missions in the ﬁ eld had climbed to almost US$8 billion a year, also reﬂ ecting the fact that missions today “last on average three times longer than their predecessors” 38 (United Nations 2015, 11).

In 2015, for instance, roughly 1.5 million refugees sought asylum in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, nearly twice as many as in the previous year. Funding for the immediate response to this crisis came in large part from ofﬁ cial development assistance. Development aid spent on refugees in host countries doubled between 2014 and 2015 and increased sixfold since 2010, reaching a total of US$12 billion (9.1 percent of total overseas development assistance). 40 The evolving geography of conflict is driving these cost increases as much as the escalation of violence.

Between 1946 and 1991, more than 23 percent of conﬂ icts were brought to an end by means of permanent peace settle- ments or ceaseﬁ re agreements; the propor- tion increased to almost 29 percent between 1991 and 2014 (Kreutz 2010; see ﬁ gure 1.10). The use of mediation declined in the early 2000s, yet remains well above Cold War levels (Wallensteen and Svensson 2014). While the long-term effectiveness of the mediation of violent intrastate conﬂ ict has been challenged (Beardsley 2008, 2011; Fortna 2003), recent research suggests that negotiated settlements are effective at reduc- ing violence in at least the ﬁ rst few years after an agreement is signed (De Rouen and Chowdhury 2016; see ﬁ gure 1.11). Indeed, negotiated settlements can have a transformative effect on conﬂ ict dynamics even when they fail. For example, violent conﬂ icts that restart after collapse of a negotiated settlement result in signiﬁ cantly fewer fatalities relative to the presettlement death toll.

Moreover, the nature of these wars—with multiple ﬁ ghting factions, signiﬁ cant involvement of outside states, and the deep societal divisions that the conﬂ icts feed and reﬂ ect—challenges the existing interna- tional and state-based conﬂ ict-resolution mechanisms (Walter 2017a). Conclusion Violent conﬂ ict remains the exception, not the rule, in today’s world. But it remains a signiﬁ cant threat to the stability of coun- tries and regions. Violent conﬂ ict has become more complex, more international- ized, and more multidimensional. It affects more middle-income countries, but is also stubbornly entrenched in low-income countries. In both cases, violent conﬂ icts are contagious. The international system created after World War II is rooted in the collective desire to prevent violent conﬂ ict through norms, values, and peace mechanisms. But it is challenged on many fronts in a world where communication, ﬁ nance, crime, and ideas ﬂ ow seamlessly across borders.

Responding to violence after it has broken out is more expensive than ever, underscor- ing the need to move beyond crisis response and recovery to a focus on prevention. This chapter has reviewed current trends in violent conﬂ ict, the nature of the risks, and the opportunities for prevention. The study turns next to an exploration of the context in which violent conﬂ icts are hap- pening, focusing on some of the key sys- temic risks posed by global trends, and the implications for prevention. Notes 1. Intensity is deﬁ ned as the number of conﬂ ict-related deaths and injuries. 2. Most of the numbers referred to in this chapter are based on the UCDP and Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) deﬁ nitions of state-based armed conﬂ ict as “a contested incompatibility which concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths” and nonstate FIGURE 1.11 The Onset and End of Armed Conflict Worldwide, 1950–2013 Source: Uppsala Conﬂ ict Data Program (Kreutz 2010). 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 1950–59 Number of conflicts 1960–69 1970–79 1980–89 1990–99 2000–09 2010–13 Average number of onsets per year Average number of terminations per year"}

The data on state-based conﬂ icts cover the years 1946–2016 (Allansson, Melander, and Themnér 2017; Gleditsch et al. 2002), while the data on nonstate violent conﬂ icts cover the years 1989–2016 (Sundberg, Eck, and Kreutz 2012; Allansson, Melander, and Themnér 2017). UCDP is the source for the majority of trends on the character and intensity of violent conﬂ icts in this chapter. Figure 1.1 includes conﬂ icts that have resulted in at least 25 battle-related deaths in a given year. 3. Pinker and Mack (2014) note, “The end of the Cold War … saw a steep reduction in the number of armed conﬂ icts of all kinds, including civil wars. ” While it is true that the rate of violent conﬂ icts between state forces and a nonstate actor had been decreasing since the end of the Cold War, it has been increasing in recent years, as has the rate of conﬂ icts between nonstate actors—although the latter is not explored in Pinker and Mack (2014), given the low number of battle deaths reported by these conﬂ icts. 4. UCDP reports four conﬂ icts with more than 1,000 fatalities each for 2007 and 13 for 2016 (Allansson, Melander, and Themnér 2017; Gleditsch et al. 2002; Sundberg, Eck, and Kreutz 2012). 5.

UCDP reports 63 state-based and nonstate conﬂ icts with between 25 and 999 battle- related deaths for 2007 and 101 for 2016 (Allansson, Melander, and Themnér 2017; Gleditsch et al. 2002; Sundberg, Eck, and Kreutz 2012). 6. Figures 1.2 and 1.3 use the best estimate for battle-related deaths in violent conﬂ icts, including those that involve state forces and those that do not; ﬁ gure 1.3 also includes fatalities stemming from one-sided violence. 7. Nonstate armed groups include rebel organi- zations and violent extremist groups; political militias or “armed gangs” operating on behalf of political actors; and communal and ethnic militias, which can act as local security pro- viders or can engage in intercommunal con- ﬂ ict, often not engaging with the state (for example, the Fulani ethnic militia in Nigeria). 8. The Islamic State is known by several other names, including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and its Arabic language acronym with a negative connotation, Daesh. 9.

In fact, the use of such militias is often a sign of strong state capacity (see Kishi, Aucoin, and Raleigh 2016; Raleigh and Kishi 2017). 10. UCDP/PRIO deﬁ nes internationalized con- ﬂ ict as those where one side is a state and one side is a nonstate and where an outside state intervenes on behalf of one of these (Allansson, Melander, and Themnér 2017; Gleditsch et al. 2002). 11. “This appears to be because credible guaran- tees on the terms of an agreement are almost impossible to design by the combatants themselves” (Walter 2017a, 1). 12. UCDP does not report any violent conﬂ icts involving state forces ending in 2016 (Allansson, Melander, and Themnér 2017; Gleditsch et al. 2002). As this study was being prepared, it was too early to say which con- ﬂ icts that were active in 2016 might or might not be active in 2017. Hence, ﬁ gure 1.6 extends only to 2015. Several factors account for the stark difference in the duration (number of years, on average) of violent conﬂ icts involving state forces that ended in 2014 versus those that ended in 2015. In 2014, 56 percent of violent conﬂ icts had lasted more than 20 years and 44 percent had lasted less than 10 years. In 2015, in contrast, 31 percent had lasted more than 20 years and 69 percent had lasted less"}

Otherwise, conﬂ ict is likely to recur” (Wolff, Ross, and Wee 2017). 14. Gang violence, which is prevalent in the Americas, is not systematically included here, as it was mentioned previously in the analysis of armed groups. 15. Political-religious divides and territorial claims are also major drivers, both of which may conﬂ ate with issues related to political power. 16. In 2015, approximately 19 percent of battle- ﬁ eld deaths occurred in the Arab world."}

These states also had highly repressive human rights policies and practiced capital punishment, among other commonalities (see Gleditsch and Rudolfsen 2016). 18. In Iraq, long-standing grievances are increasingly manifesting themselves in the creation of cross-sectarian alliances as an expression of widespread and diverse popu- lar dissatisfaction with the ruling elites. Iraq also has a history of long-standing tensions between Arabs and Kurds. 19. For example, the global recruitment of Western foreign ﬁ ghters through technology and other means (ICG 2016a). 20. While the international recruitment of young people by groups such as the Islamic State has received much attention, the strength of such groups in Iraq, for example, has come from the local co-optation of the old Ba’athist apparatus as well as from col- laboration with tribes that have been fright- ened by a formal state structure they perceive to be serving as an instrument of retribution for the years of Sunni domination in Iraq. Al Shabaab has also co-opted many people who had been excluded by the domination of clans in Somali politics, especially many youths. 21.

T errorism is understood here as “the threat- ened or actual use of illegal force and vio- lence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious or social goal through fear, coercion or intimidation” (National Consortium for the Study of T errorism and Responses to T errorism 2016). This deﬁ ni- tion renders it difﬁ cult to distinguish events from warfare during violent conﬂ ict (Hoffman 2006). 24. Illicit ﬁ nancing of nonstate actors is not limited to the sale of drugs. 25. “An exact estimate for the economic cost of violent conﬂ ict is hard to derive. The very existence of a conﬂ ict makes measurement of economic activity problematic . . . [and so numbers] ought to be interpreted with this in mind. . . .

Hultman (2010) suggests three mechanisms that may result in this behavior: “First, if an intervention makes the warring parties expect a settlement of the conﬂ ict, they might target civilians as a last-minute strat- egy to establish territorial control. Second, if the intervention alters the balance of power between the warring parties or hinders mili- tary clashes, the warring parties might turn to violence against civilians as a cheaper strategy of imposing costs on the adversary. Third, if an intervention challenges the warring parties’ ability to extract natural resources or to engage in criminal economic activity, it might trigger them to increase violent looting behavior in order to main- tain control over resources. ” 28. Attacks on schools and hospitals are consid- ered one of the six grave violations under the August 1999 UN Security Council Resolution (S/RES/1261) on Children and Armed Conﬂ ict (see also ICRC 2017; Sassoli 2004). 29.

Other estimates put the ﬁ gure in excess of 800,000, suggesting that UCDP underesti- mates the scale of the genocide. No genocide has been comparable in scale to that of Rwanda for more than 20 years. However, several massive genocides occurred between 1955 and 1994. 32.

This ﬁ gure is based on the Global Peace Index, which includes 16 separate categories with estimated costs, including the losses from crime and interpersonal violence ($2.5 trillion) and losses from conﬂ ict ($742 billion), as well as the costs of contain- ing violence through internal security spending ($4.2 trillion) and military spend- ing ($6.2 trillion) (IEP 2015). 34. Does the outcome of prevention and inter- vention justify its cost? In cases where it is not deemed “successful, ” arguing its justiﬁ - cation can be more difﬁ cult. Valentino (2011), for example, argues, “Intervening militarily to save lives abroad often sounds good on paper, but the record has not been promising. The ethical calculus involved is almost always complicated by messy realities on the ground, and the opportunity costs of such missions are massive. Well-meaning countries could save far more lives by help- ing refugees and victims of natural disasters and funding public health. ” 35.

This chapter explores how the trend of violence without borders has emerged in a global context where the balance of geo- political power is in ﬂ ux and transnational factors like advances in information and communication technology (ICT), popu- lation movements, and climate change cre- ate risks and opportunities to be managed at multiple levels. 1 It highlights the central- ity of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as an organizing template for prevention and examines patterns of gov- ernance, pressures at all levels for more inclusive forms of political organization, and changing economic structures. It also reviews the complexity of these global trends that form the landscape against which states and other actors navigate change in pursuit of sustainable peace. The international system designed to save the world from “the scourge of war” at the conclusion of World War II was formed in the context of still-pressing threats and dark memories of war between nations (UN 1945, 1).

The adoption of global norms and values, including those pertaining to human rights, further embodied the collec- tive commitment to managing problems through international governance institu- tions. As noted in chapter 1, those systems and norms are being called on to respond to a resurgence of violent conﬂ ict that is test- ing the postwar order. The geopolitical balance in the world is shifting. The rise of new global pow- ers affects not only political and eco- nomic equilibriums but also peace efforts (Call and de Coning 2017). Rising ten- sions among great powers affect the mul- tilateral system at its core, most notably in the United Nations (UN) Security Council, and increasingly tend to spill over into proxy wars. Proxy wars, more- over, are not the exclusive purview of traditional or emerging great powers. A multipolar international system is con- solidating, where regional powers easily find room to pursue their own strategic interests independently. A push for political inclusion is clearly visible within nations as well as in the inter- national system. The number of societies that have adopted more inclusive forms of political and economic governance over the last 30 years has grown rapidly.

Rapid advances in ICT present opportunities for innovation, growth, and the unfet- tered exchange of ideas and inclusive nar- ratives. But these advances have negative aspects too. Interconnectivity enables transnational organized crime to flourish, allows the rapid transmission of violent ideologies, and leaves economies vulnera- ble to cybercrime. Climate change, mass movements of people, and the unmet expectations of a growing population of young people in low- and middle-income countries also present risks that challenge governments on all levels. The ability of global systems to distribute the opportu- nities equitably and to manage the risks that accompany these rapid changes is increasingly in question. Changes in the global landscape as well as within societies have major implications for the prevention of violent conﬂ ict. Prevention, as elaborated throughout this study and in line with the joint UN Sustaining Peace Resolutions (UNSC 2016; UN General Assembly 2016), is a pro- cess aimed at minimizing incentives for violence, while boost ing incentives for peace.

An International System in Search of a New Equilibrium A T ransition in the World Order The framework of multilateralism, interna- tional law, and treaties dedicated to manag- ing peace and security has weathered many storms over the past 70 years, and global institutions continue to adapt to new chal- lenges. The global balance of power and the environment in which global institutions operate are also shifting. It is widely argued that a transition to a multipolar world is underway (Guterres 2017), with new centers of political, eco- nomic, and military power emerging. T oday, growing economic power for emerg- ing economies and the achievement by many countries of middle-income status bring demands for the redistribution of global political inﬂ uence. Pressure to redraw normative boundaries in key areas of inter- national law (such as human rights or the status of women) is mounting.

Many coun- tries seek to renegotiate power sharing in multilateral forums, such as the UN and international ﬁ nancial institutions (Grifﬁ n, forthcoming; Haass 2017). The pressure for greater inclusion and wider representation in global governance is marked by the emergence of informal and more ﬂ exible forums such as the G-20, which facilitates economic and financial cooperation among countries representing more than 80 percent of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP) and almost two-thirds of the world’s population. 2 The growing need for ﬂ exible instru- ments is also apparent when it comes to preventing violent conﬂ ict and sustaining peace. On the one hand, the United Nations remains the pivotal institution in this sector. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), not only con- ﬁ rms that sustainable development is the overaching goal in its own right, but also provides a universal framework for address- ing the root causes of conﬂ ict, recognizing the deep complexity and interconnected- ness on the path to peace and progress.

Regional responses to the risk of violent conﬂ ict, however, have been uneven in their ability to sustain peace. Furthermore, regional competition can fuel unilateral action, prolonging and aggravating conﬂ icts and weakening the capacity of regional organizations to play a role in preventing violent conﬂ icts. The international law on conﬂ ict has evolved as well, becoming increasingly sophis- ticated (see box 7.2). Commitment to preven- tion has also been renewed, including at the 2005 World Summit. The United Nations and its partners have built consensus around chal- lenging issues, producing major international agreements such as the 2015 Paris Accord on Climate Change. A series of high-level reports have consistently recognized the need for a stronger focus on prevention. This analytical effort has been consolidated into important resolutions, including the twin Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on sustaining peace (UNSC 2016; UN General Assembly 2016).

{"page": 87, "text": "e Inclusive Societies Some states are becoming progressively more open to sharing power and including citizens in political participation. This has been happening in extended waves since the eighteenth century and continues today. A new wave began in the 1970s and broad- ened after the end of the Cold War with a strong increase in the number of countries with more democratic forms of govern- ment (Strand et al. 2012). The number of states with democratic forms of govern- ment grew from 45 among 150 states in 1974 to 121 among 193 states in 2003 (Menocal, Fritz, and Rakner 2007). The 2015 Global Attitudes Survey ﬁ nds support for democratic values in countries across all regions, although the support varies. Large majorities tend to value reli- gious freedom and an impartial judicial system, while smaller majorities tend to support multiparty elections, free speech, and censorship-free media (Pew Research Center 2015). The World Values Survey, a global survey of basic values and beliefs, similarly concludes, “Democracy has an overwhelming positive image throughout the world” (Freedom House 2004, 5) and has become, over the last decade, “virtually the only political model with global appeal, no matter what the culture” (Freedom House 2004, 5).

The sixth round of the World Values Survey, which collected data from 2010 to 2014, ﬁ nds that on average people ranked living in a democratically governed country as “highly important, ” with the lowest average of the distribution being 6.4 out of 10 (World Values Survey Association 2014). This recent push for more inclusive pol- itics has been driven partly by the availabil- ity of social media and communication tools. The growth in interconnectivity and transparency in the world has opened win- dows, showing people how others live, rais- ing awareness of global inequality, and providing a platform for expression. These tools have been important factors in many political transformations, coming more from the middle class and educated youth than from the poor or marginalized (Devarajan and Ianchovichina 2017). While this push for more inclusive and transparent government is a positive sign for long-term, sustainable peace (Doyle 1986; Russett 1993; T omz and Weeks 2013) and has occurred peacefully in many coun- tries, it also carries increased risk. Chapters 4 and 5 explore in more detail some of these risks and opportunities and their implica- tions for prevention.

The ﬁ g- ure plots the annual likelihood for the following: • Onset of any of these ﬁ ve categories • Onset of all categories excluding major democratic transition • A period of political instability or “con- solidated cases. ” Across all plots, “anocracies have the greatest risk of instability, while autocracies and unconsolidated democracies have a lesser, yet still substantial, risk” (Center for Systemic Peace 2014). The rising number of anocracies and the high degree of instability associated with periods of anocracy have important implications for prevention, in that they intensify the risk of conﬂ ict that might escalate to violence. Political transitions can be bidirectional. Freedom House suggests that in 2016, scores for freedom declined in 67 countries but rose in 36 and that 2016 was the eleventh consecutive year in which declines in freedom outnumbered improvements (Puddington and Roylance 2017).

Most striking is that, as opposed to earlier years, established democracies 5—not autocracies or dictatorships—dominated the list of countries suffering setbacks as measured by the Freedom House rankings (Freedom House 2017). This alludes to the fact that democracies are not homogenous and that issues like inequality are on the rise even in democratic systems. Changing Economic Structures The global economy has grown substan- tially since the end of Wor ld War II. Global GDP growth has been associated with increasing trade openness and poverty reduction. Between 1990 and 2014, for instance, the share of world GDP encom- passing international trade grew from US$3.5 trillion to US$18.9 trillion. The cor- relation between trade openness and per capita GDP growth at the global level is ﬁ rmly established (see ﬁ gure 2.3). While trade and technology have pro- vided “ladders” for rapid growth, individual countries’ ability to beneﬁ t fully from advances in trade and technology critically depends on their own characteristics (Bartley Johns et al. 2015). Trade and tech- nology have acted in a complementary way, in large part due to several technological and logistical advances that have improved mobility, communications, and ﬁ nancial systems, such as containerization and infor- mation technology. There are also fewer barriers to global trade and ﬁ nance. T"}

There are also fewer barriers to global trade and ﬁ nance. Trade agreements and trade and ﬁ nancial deepening have multi- plied in tandem, with the Wor ld Trade Organization (WTO) playing an import- ant role in advocating and managing an inclusive global trading system and setting the “rules of the game” for regional trade agreements. Overall, trade dynamics since 1990 have been one of the contributors to the historic improvement in living stan- dards across the world and to a reduction in the share of the world population living in extreme poverty (below $1.90 a day, in 2011 dollars at purchasing power parity) from 35 percent in 1990 to around 11 per- cent in 2013 (Ferreira, Joliffe, and Prydz 2015). The global economy, nonetheless, con- tinues to face many challenges. While global trade has grown, growth has not been evenly spread. Rather, trade growth has been marked by downturns and a pro- longed period of only modest improvement since the global ﬁ nancial crisis of 2007, fall- ing, for the ﬁ fth consecutive year, below 3 percent in 2016. These values are well below the average of 7 percent between 1987 and 2007.

A lthough the volume of global trade has increased, the value of global trade has fallen as a result of shifting exchange rates and lower commodity prices (WTO 2017). Meanwhile, for eign direct invest- ment (FDI) to developing countries, which has been empirically found to contribute to higher wages, productivity, and employ- ment, has also been decreasing since 2011 (United Nations 2017a), adversely affecting growth and productivity (Hale and"}
{"page": 90, "text": "54 Pathways for Peace Xu 2016). From 2015 to 2016, global FDI ﬂ ows decreased by 7 percent to US$1.625 billion and stayed below their precrisis peak, representing approximately 2.2 per- cent of global GDP compared with 3.6 per- cent in 2007 (OECD 2017; see ﬁ gure 2.4). These trends and others create addi- tional challenges for development. For example, the reduction in the incidence of extreme poverty since 1981 has relied heav- ily on the strong and rapid growth of the global economy. But given the current slow pace of global economic growth and the potential for this trend to persist, many countries face issues in sustaining poverty reduction at the same rhythm as in previous decades. This trend may jeopardize progress toward attainment of the SDGs (SDG 1), calling on the international community to intensify its efforts to combat extreme poverty. Despite the fact that inequality between countries has decreased globally, inequality within countries remains high (World Bank 2016b) because economic interdependence and globalization have increased without equal distribution of the gains. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (SDG 10) identiﬁ es the reduction of inequality, both within countries as well as globally, as a priority of the international community (UN 2015).

Recent analysis by the Int ernational Monetary Fund shows that the labor share of income has been on a downward trend in high-income economies since the 1980s and in low- and middle-in- come countries since the early 1990s (IMF 2017). 6 This decline in the labor share of income has been associated with an increase in income inequality in many parts of the world. In addition, unemployment rates remain high in many regions, especially in those with high populations of youth. Challenges to reducing in-country inequality include technological change, such as the increase in automation and routiniza- tion of tasks. Although technological progress and the globalization of trade and capital have contributed strongly to overall global growth and prosperity as well as to income conver- gence in low- and middle- income countries, they have had disproportionate and asymmetric impacts across countries, indus- tries, and workers of different skill groups.

The speed of change leads many to believe that technological change, including automation shifts, is, in the long term, “the most important force shaping the labor mar- ket and income inequality” (Hallward- Driemeier and Nayyar 2017). While all of these recent trends pose challenges, they do not directly affect vio- lent conﬂ ict. Instead, they put additional stresses on systems and people and can increase the tendency for groups to mobi- lize to address perceived grievances, which can culminate in violence. In a world where interconnectivity is stronger than ever and transparency is possible through an ever- increasing number of ICT platforms, in most societies the growth of the global economy has generated greater expecta- tions and aspirations for the future. When these expectations and aspirations are unmet, because of the weak capacity of governments to provide for their constitu- ents, the inability of labor markets to pro- vide jobs, or the uneven distribution of global wealth, frustration and tensions associated with job creation, employment, and wages can rise (Piketty 2013).

Rising uncertainty about receiving one’s fair share of national or global wealth and being able to achieve indi- vidual aspirations has led to mixed feelings regarding the beneﬁ ts of globalization. A poll of 19 countries shows that globalization is met with increasing skepticism, with mixed views on immigration and trade (see ﬁ gure 2.5). While enthusiasm for economic globalization is high among people from lower- and mid- dle-income countries that are experiencing higher growth rates, people from high- income countries with modest growth are more apprehensive (Pew Research Center 2007). Thus, while changing economic struc- tures and the reduction of the role of labor as an economic factor of production in the postindustrial age are not a direct cause of violent conﬂ ict, they generate stress while systems and people adapt. The problem is particularly complex in low- and lower- middle-income countries that have only partially gone through an industrial transi- tion and that have a labor force with low skills.

Fast-moving advancements in ICT, however, also have problematic conse- quences. While more people are connected to ICT than ever before—with an esti- mated 3.2 billion now using the Internet (ITU 2015)—access remains uneven, exacerbating tensions related to exclusion (World Economic Forum 2015). ICT tools for monitoring and managing conﬂ ict such as early-warning systems and crowd- sourcing technologies can improve the ﬂ ow of information and, in some ways, facilitate direct communication between state and society. Similarly, new ICT tools, like social media, offer new platforms for expressing grievances and ﬁ nding com- mon ground or potentially channeling those grievances toward violence (Mor, Ron, and Maoz 2016). By lowering the cost of collective action, advances in ICT enable armed groups, and violent extrem- ist groups in particular, to recruit globally on an unprecedented scale (Smith et al. 2015).

With the advent of Web 2.0, social media platforms, and other ICT tools, the number of people using the Internet globally has risen steeply (figure 2.6). Nevertheless, 3.9 billion people in low- and middle-income countries, equivalent to 53 percent of the world’s population, are not connected (see map 2.1).

This digital divide cuts people off from the potential cross-cultural exchange and discourse that come with increasing interconnectivity. Internet penetration has direct implica- tions for economic progress. Every 10 percent increase in broadband penetra- tion in low- and middle-income countries is estimated to have a 1.38 percent increase in GDP (Independent Commission on Multilateralism 2016). The digital divide can aggravate exclusion and inequality, since “some segments of the population may be exposed differently than others to labor market shifts induced by technological innovation, which can aggravate inequali- ties across groups with different skill levels. In the absence of close monitoring, ICTs could contribute to inequality, thus exacerbating tensions rather than mitigat- ing them” (World Economic Forum 2015).

For that purpose, UNDP developed a GIS-enabled desktop database tool, and used geo-referenced analysis to work with state governments, as well as national security, development, and informal actors to identify preemptive interventions based on perceptions of risk and tension after the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.

ICT as a Means to Achieve the Unﬁ ltered Exchanges of Views T ools like social media can mitigate the risk of violent conﬂ ict through online platforms for dialogue and conciliation (Mor, Ron, and Maoz 2016). A study of Israelis and Palestinians using the Facebook platform showed that Facebook posts emphasizing moderate Palestinian voices promoting peace elicited higher sympathy and accep- tance (Mor, Ron, and Maoz 2016). Social media can encourage and enable back and forth communications among people, dif- ferentiating them from traditional media communications and mass media outreach that are typically one way and susceptible to power control. Social media are a means, therefore, to mobilize people collectively to nonviolent or violent action. Social media messaging services like Twitter also can serve as outlets for people to express their views and discontent peacefully, by provid- ing access to larger networks and freedom to speak or associate (Davison 2015).

Chapters 3 and 4 discuss in greater detail collective mobilization in terms of the risk and pre- vention of violent conﬂ ict. ICT and the Risk of Violence ICTs can put inequalities into sharp relief and create a space for inciting violence. Recent research on the effect of ICTs on violence indicates that the most important impact is through collective action (Weidmann 2015). But traditional media can play signiﬁ cant roles as well. In the Rwandan genocide, approximately 10 percent of the participation in the vio- lence was attributed to the effects of radio broadcasts (Boggero 2017; Y anagizawa- Drott 2014). Mobile long-distance commu- nication also changes the way information ﬂ ows, with varying effects on violent activ- ity (Pierskalla and Hollenbach 2013). For example, one analysis ﬁ nds that the diffu- sion of cell phones affected the propensity for political violence in Iraq, where the location of cell phone towers was negatively associated with violence (Shapiro and Weidmann 2015); another shows that the availability of cell phones substantially increased the probability of violent conﬂ ict and can amplify the effect of economic downturns on political mobilization"}

ICT and the Reach of Violent Extremist Groups It is broadly recognized that violent extremist ideologies have harnessed the “technological revolution, ” adversely affecting international, regional, and state stability (Boggero 2017). Social media have played multiple roles in violent extremism (Smith et al. 2015), includ- ing allowing violent extremist groups to use the online space to coordinate group behavior on a large scale and catalyze grassroots action from anywhere in the world (V eilleux-Lepage 2016). Groups, including but not limited to violent extremist groups, can use social media platforms to mobilize support among persons whose grievances and anxieties about the future have already reached or are close to reaching a critical level. Excluded identity groups and youth are prime targets (Allan et al. 2015; Crenshaw 1981; Fjelde and Østby 2014; Miodownik and Nir 2016; Ross 1993).

This may entail enforcement of existing norms or creation of new norms where needed (G7 2017). Additionally, they should ensure that technology is leveraged in the many ways that it can be for building peace, addressing risks of conﬂ ict, and communicating nar- ratives that create incentives for peace rather than violence. This will allow societ- ies to realize the potential of ICT as an instrument for sustaining peace and miti- gate the risks of violent conﬂ ict that are too often easily exploited. Indeed, navigating change by fostering inclusiveness and, thus, social cohesion is the essence of prevention, as this study argues throughout. Demographic Change and Populations on the Move Population Growth, Y outh, and Aging Demographic shifts may create new stresses on global and national systems that carry implications for prevention.

The increased use of cyberspace as a domain for hostilities has been increasingly apparent (Singer and Friedman 2014), and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has declared it the ﬁ fth domain of warfare. Research suggests, “As the barriers to entry in the cyber domain are low, cyberspace includes many and varied actors—from criminal hackers to terrorist networks to governments engaged in cyber espionage” (Independent Commission on Multilateralism 2016). Moreover, cybercrime and cyberattacks can “undermine the safety of Internet users, disrupt economic and commercial activity, and threaten military effectiveness” (Independent Commission on Multilateralism 2016). Many have argued for a treaty addressing cyber security that is more comprehensive than those that govern nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.

In 2001, the Budapest Convention—or Convention on Cybercrime—required “parties to harmonize domestic criminal legislation and promote international collaboration in addressing transnational cybercrime” (Council of Europe 2001). However, the UN Working Group on Countering the Use of the Internet for Terrorist Purposes has concluded thus far that cyber terrorism is “not yet a threat serious enough to warrant separate legislation” (Independent Commission on Multilateralism 2016). Privacy rights play a prominent role in developing legal frameworks around cyber security. Big data can be a severe risk not just to privacy but also to individual security. This is a critical area for attention, as privacy in conﬂ ict- affected areas can be a question of life or death. What constitutes a cybercrime and how existing international law is to be applied are heated elements of this debate. Some initiatives have aimed to provide clarity in this matter, resulting in an emerging consensus that international law, and speciﬁ cally the UN charter, is applicable to cyberspace. These include a report by the Group of Governmental Experts a as well as the Tallinn Manual created by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence. aThe third Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security."}

Already there are more young people in the world than at any other time in history— 1.8 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24—and the vast majority of young people live in low- and middle-income countries (UNDESA 2015b). In Africa, 60 percent of the population is under the age of 25 (UNDESA 2015a), compared with around 40 percent in Asia and in Latin America and the Caribbean (UNDESA 2015c). Populations are also aging in parallel with this population growth: 12 percent of the global population is now 60 years or older. Rapidly aging populations create pressures on societies with low fertility rates. Europe has the largest percentage of older persons (24 percent), but by 2050, all regions except for Africa will have around one-quarter or more of their population 60 years of age or older (UNDESA 2015c). Having more old and young people rely on a disproportionately smaller working-age population places a heavy burden on the share of the population that is of working age (Grifﬁ n, forthcoming).

Greater Expectations and Pressures Due to Demographic Shifts Major demographic shifts are creating potential vulnerabilities and risks. While demographic change in itself does not cause conﬂ ict, it can potentially put pressure on systems and societies, increasing the risk for conﬂ ict. A large youth population puts huge pressure on education systems to provide decent learning and skills that will allow young people to become more meaning- fully engaged and included in their societies. Many countries with high demographic growth are seeing their education system struggle to provide even quality basic education (World Bank 2018). Pop- ulation growth, while a positive force for economies, also puts pressure on labor markets, which will have to absorb the esti- mated 600 million new workers entering the markets in the next 10 years (ILO 2016). Similarly, increasing levels of educa- tional attainment create greater aspira- tions; compounded with increasing transparency of the world via the ICT rev- olution, young people are more aware of how others live and succeed.

These rising expectations are difﬁ cult for many societies to meet, creating the risk that people will grow dissatisﬁ ed with the social contract in their country because they have come to expect services and opportunities that are not provided to them. For instance, research on aspirations and well-being in the Middle East shows that many young people, better educated than their parents and previous genera- tions, aspire to meet social and economic milestones like ﬁ nding a good job after school, getting married, and being socially recognized as important (Devarajan and Ianchovichina 2017). However, they are often unable to do so because of a lagging economy, skills mismatch, and lack of mobility, and so they grow increasingly frustrated (Cammett and Diwan 2013). Addressing these challenges requires not only creating a societal framework that integrates people successfully, but also investing directly in children and youth.

With these challenges in mind, many individuals migrate to other places in search of better socioeconomic opportunities. Record-Breaking Migration Migration and the historic movement of peo- ple in recent years is a deﬁ ning trend in today’s world (UNDESA 2016). In 2015, there were approximately 250 million international migrants throughout the world (World Bank 2016a), up from 173 million in 2000 (UNDESA 2016), and women constituted 48 percent of the total (World Bank 2016a). Well- managed migration can offer many beneﬁ ts and is an alternative to enduring the con- straints felt by demographic transitions. Migrants contribute to their host countries by ﬁ lling critical labor shortages, paying taxes and social security contributions, and creating jobs as entrepreneurs. Globally, a vast major- ity of migrants (72 percent) are of working age (UNDESA 2016). Migration also can contribute to reducing the pace of population aging and, hence, old-age dependency ratios. Migration can be important for home communities as well. For instance, since 2000 remittances sent to low- and middle- income countries have increased by more than 500 percent, reaching US$441 billion in 2015 (Dugarova and Gulasan 2017).

In origin countries, emigration can often lead to the loss of valuable human resources such as doctors, nurses, and teachers, but it can also lower unemployment and facilitate trade, investment, and technology trans- fers. Moreover, some migrants who become successful abroad invest in their home countries, bringing home capital, trade, ideas, skills, and technology (UN 2017b).

This requires providing urgent help to countries that have not yet undergone a demographic transition, especially those with scarce resources. Giving children security and the opportunity to receive a quality education is vital and a core element of early conﬂ ict prevention. Moreover, migration needs bet- ter management, within countries, intra- regionally, and internationally. Better management cannot be achieved without the right legal frameworks and processes for migrants, such as the provision of identity cards and papers. Along with improving legislation on asset ownership, such as land and housing (see chapter 5 on land), con- ﬂ ict management systems at the local level need to be strengthened. While much attention is focused on migration across continents, intraregional migration and rural-urban migration constitute the bulk of the population movements. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, intraregional migration is higher (67 percent) than migration to other regions (World Bank 2016a). Often this migration has beneﬁ cial aspects because it brings people closer to resources and livelihoods.

Intraregional migration can be a source of major tension and can give rise to civil war or severe cases of violence. Growing numbers of people looking for resources and livelihoods can exacerbate tensions across fault lines, as in the conﬂ ict in Mindanao, one cause of which is thought to have been the mass migration of Christian populations to ancestral Muslim lands (Parks, Colletta, and Oppenheim 2013), or in Nigeria’s Middle Belt, which was caused mostly by nomadic herders searching for water and fodder in areas largely populated by sedentary farmers (Marc, V erjee, and Mogaka 2015). In Côte d’Ivoire, conﬂ icts over land management were ignited between migrants from the north of the country as well as from other countries and local communities during and after the civil war (McGovern 2011). In places like the semiarid regions of northern Kenya and the Sahel region of West Africa (Marc, V erjee, and Mogaka 2015), conﬂ icts are endemic between nomadic herders moving southward and farmers in the southern areas.

Pastoral and agricultural livelihoods depend on mutu- ally beneﬁ cial and negotiated, nonexclusive access to water and reciprocal land use agreements. Conﬂ icts arise when access to water points, grazing lands, and pastoral corridors are restricted and crops are dam- aged. Increased herd sizes and environmen- tal degradation have increased the frequency and intensity of these conﬂ icts. Migration also has impacts on the areas left behind. If a large proportion of the working-age population migrates, they often leave behind family members of either younger or older generations. This may create a gap in the labor force and social fabric. Resulting low-density areas may experience challenges with service pro- vision and local governance mechanisms, dynamics that some armed groups could see as an opportunity. The Flow of Forcibly Displaced Persons Another major challenge today is the large- scale forced displacement across countries and regions as well as the ﬂ ow of internally displaced persons (IDPs). As noted in chapter 1, conﬂ ict, generalized violence, and persecution are forcibly uprooting people on a large scale.

While these ﬂ ows can strain the eco- nomic resources and capacities of many host countries, including conﬂ ict-affected countries, forcibly displaced persons rarely spread conﬂ ict to host communities and countries (World Bank 2017). A review of 82 countries that received more than 25,000 refugees for at least a year between 1991 and 2014 ﬁ nds that about 68 percent of these countries did not experience any conﬂ ict (World Bank 2017). In the 32 percent of hosting countries that did experience con- ﬂ ict, refugees were determined to have a role in causing conﬂ ict in only 0.8 percent of cases (World Bank 2017). In addition, the wage and employment effects were small because refugees and natives did not com- pete for the same jobs. Instead, refugees often have a net positive effect on govern- ment budgets (World Bank 2017).

Still, urbanization offers many opportu- nities for conﬂ ict prevention. Historically, the development of urban centers has helped to facilitate contact across different identity groups, creating a stronger sense of citizenship, building social networks, and stimulating trade and exchange.

Climate change poses immense threats to sustainable devel- opment, affecting people through changes in mean conditions such as temperature, precipitation, and sea level (Barnett and Adger 2007) over long periods of time and through greater frequency and severity of extreme weather events (Hallegatte et al. 2016). The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (SDG 13) commits the inter- national community to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impact. In the absence of preventive action, global warming may exceed 4°C by the end of the twenty-ﬁ rst century, facilitating “severe, widespread, and irreversible” impacts on poverty reduction and development (Hallegatte et al. 2016; IPCC 2014, 17). The impacts of climate change cut across both the short and long term. Environmentally, climate change leads to rising sea levels, ocean acidiﬁ cation, melting glaciers and polar ice caps, and increased pollution that affects both animal and human health (National Intelligence Council 2017). Increasing pressure on envi- ronmental systems also affects the avail- ability of water and biodiversity, threatening livelihoods and intensifying competition for natural resources such as farm and grazing land. Economically, climate change can affect household consumption by lead- ing to spikes in food prices, decreasing pro- ductivity, and eroding ﬁ"}

Economically, climate change can affect household consumption by lead- ing to spikes in food prices, decreasing pro- ductivity, and eroding ﬁ nancial, physical, human, social, and natural capital assets (Burke, Hsiang, and Edward 2015). Climate change unevenly affects certain places and people, including fragile and conﬂ ict-affected settings. A largely uncon- tested evidence base indicates that, regard- less of the exact nature and magnitude of change, climate change has a dispropor- tionate impact on poor and vulnerable countries and communities (Nordas and Gleditsch 2007). This is especially true for people who are more dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods and jobs and who cannot easily adapt to ﬂ uctuations in their supply. For example, a decline in pre- cipitation can be dangerous for people around the world already working at sub- sistence levels. In Timor Leste, 85 percent of the population relies on agriculture as the main source of income, with most of the population being subsistence farmers (Barnett and Adger 2007). A lack of rainfall in the dry season can reduce crop produc- tion by up to one-third, increasing the risk for pervasive hunger and famine as well as migration and competition for resources (Barnett and Adger 2007).

Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, thus increasing the risk of complex crises and human insecurity (USAID 2014). It may reduce access to natural resources important for sustaining livelihoods, or it may degrade the quality of those resources. In such contexts, direct resource competi- tion from relative scarcity or abundance of a speciﬁ c natural resource can create ten- sions within and among groups. Schleussner et al.

There is also strong evidence that cli- mate change acts as a threat multiplier, indirectly escalating the risk of conﬂ ict through mechanisms such as food insecu- rity, economic shocks, and migration. Evidence in a growing body of literature on the impact of climatic variability on violent conﬂ ict shows that low water availability and very high and low temperatures are associated with organized political con- ﬂ icts. Studies using country-level data show a correlation between changes in tem- perature and precipitation associated with economic contraction and destabilization of the political balance (Hsiang, Burke, and Miguel 2013). Overall, climate change does not auto- matically cause violent conﬂ ict. However, there is no doubt that climate change creates major stress, especially in fragile sit- uations where governments have limited means to help their population to adapt (see box 2.3).

In some countries—in particular, those on the fringes of the Sahara Desert— addressing climate change remains at the core of early conﬂ ict prevention strategies (Marc, V erjee, and Mogaka 2015). T ransnational Organized Crime Trafﬁ cking and transnational organized crime (TOC) contribute directly and indi- rectly to violent conﬂ ict. The detrimental impacts of TOC are increasingly recog- nized, 8 as are the negative ripple effects of various illicit ﬂ ows such as drug, human, and natural resource trafﬁ cking, smuggling of migrants, illicit trade of ﬁ rearms and wildlife, counterfeit medicines, and cyber- crime. The United Nations High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges, and Change has identiﬁ ed TOC as a top priority, on par with civil wars, nuclear weapons, and ter- rorism (Comolli 2017; UN 2004). The ﬁ nancial consequences of TOC are serious.

The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change expects temperatures in the Sahel to increase by 1°C over the next 20 years, 2.1°C by 2065, and 4°C by the end of the twenty-ﬁ rst century. Despite limited data on changes in environmental conditions, the Sahel has experienced more severe and recurrent droughts and ﬂ oods in past years. Combined with political, economic, and social instability; poverty; historical grievances; poor governance; and weak institutions, Sahelian states face many challenges in managing the detrimental impacts of climate change. Lake Chad is one such example that highlights the links between environmental, social, and political vulnerability. Situated between Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria, Lake Chad is a vital resource for more than 50 million people. The lake and its drainage basin provide not only jobs through food production and a rich trading economy, but also water and land for agriculture. The region itself is a focal point for agricultural production, encompassing both expanses of shallow water, vegetation, and rich soil used for a variety of purposes. In recent years, the ability of the lake region to be a net exporter of food and a source of employment has (Box continued next page)"}

Trafﬁ cking of drugs, arms, and people—the most lucrative manifestations of transna- tional organized crime—generates large criminal proceeds. Illicit drugs alone account for 17–25 percent of the total gen- erated by TOC. It is difﬁ cult to measure illicit ﬁ nancial ﬂ ows, such as money that is illegally earned, transferred, or used and that crosses borders, including transfer pric- ing and tax avoidance by multinational cor- porations. Still, Global Financial Integrity estimates that 15 low- and middle-income countries lose almost US$1 trillion per year and lost US$7.8 trillion from 2004 to 2013 (Spanjers and Salomon 2017). The yearly amount of illicit ﬁ nancial ﬂ ows from low- and middle-income countries exceeded the sum of FDI and ofﬁ cial development assis- tance that those countries received in 2013 (Spanjers and Salomon 2017). The magnitude of TOC also puts the sta- bility of many countries at risk, given increased mobility and interconnectedness today and the global impacts of illicit traf- ﬁ cking (see map 2.3). As UNODC (2010, v) notes, “Most TOC ﬂ ows begin on one conti- nent and end on another, often by means of a third. ” For instance, drug production and trade have an impact not only on countries of origin but also on consumer markets, as in the case of the An"}

West Africa also pro- vides an example of how drug trafﬁ cking undermines stability, governance, develop- ment, and health in transit regions (UNODC 2008, 35–48). The scale and reach of illicit trafﬁ cking contribute to many elements that can increase the risk of conﬂ ict or allow it to persist. Its transnational nature means that it can generate or perpetuate instabil- ity across borders (see map 2.4). Illicit traf- ﬁ cking activities can make it more likely for local conﬂ ict to spill into surrounding areas and countries, thus contributing to its regionalization. The Balkans provide a come under threat. Climate change challenges the biodiversity growing in the lake, creating a fragile ecosystem and increasing the vulnerability of the Sahel, which relies heavily on the resources of Lake Chad.

Although these groups have historically been welcomed into the area, food, water, job insecurity, and land saturation have created tensions over access to available resources. With 2.8 million displaced people in the Sahel, these tensions may rise between host and displaced communities over competition for scarce resources. Traditional conﬂ ict resolution mechanisms may no longer be adequate to help residents to cope with the scale of the growing challenge. The Sahel has experienced major tensions and violent conﬂ icts directly related to these climatic changes. Pastoralists from the northern fringes of the Sahara, who have to use transhumance to sustain their herds, increasingly move southward in search of pasture. In these areas, agriculturists are already struggling with less predictable rainfall. Pastoralists also tend to stay in these areas over a longer period of time, including when crops are ready to be harvested. These situations have created serious conﬂ ict and destruction of both crops and cattle. Herders increasingly form militias to protect their cattle, look for protection from various armed groups, and get drawn into violent conﬂ ict.

Criminal networks are actors, with agency, that should be taken into account in assessing the risk of violent conﬂ ict. They may act to undermine the legitimacy and capacity of their rivals, including the state. (Chapter 3 discusses actors and their interrelationship in greater detail.) Drug cartels in Latin America changed their behavior to avoid confrontation with the state and seek alter- native markets, shifting cocaine trafﬁ cking to West Africa (Cockayne 2013, 14–16; 2016, 267–89). By establishing parallel structures that provide economic opportu- nities and services to the local population, criminal networks (like other actors) can also degrade the image of the state in the eyes of the population. Criminal activities can underwrite parties in violent conﬂ ict, prolonging or changing the nature of the conﬂ ict. Revenues from these activities can enable parties to attract more ﬁ ghters and purchase more sophisticated weapons (Felbab-Brown 2009) and thus to ﬁ ght longer.

In 17 cases where there was major evidence of rebel groups relying on production or traf- ﬁ cking on contraband, the estimated median and mean civil war durations were 28.1 and 48.2 years, respectively, as compared to 6.0 and 8.8 years for the remaining civil wars. ” Violent conﬂ ict also opens up opportu- nities for criminality. Illicit activities tend to thrive in contexts of weak rule of law and where other forms of violence are present (World Bank 2011). In conﬂ ict settings, goods and supplies may not be easily acces- sible, and criminals adapt to ﬁ ll the demand. MAP 2.3 Global Flows of Transnational Organized Crime Source: UNODC 2010.

In spite of these dynamics, the existence of criminal economies and illicit trafﬁ cking networks in conﬂ ict situations does not automatically translate into higher levels of violence. Certain criminal groups may choose instead to operate by coercion and intimidation, especially where markets are stable and a clear hierarchy is identiﬁ ed. For instance, despite the large size of the narcot- ics economy in Afghanistan, drug-related violence remains relatively low and sizably lower than in Latin American drug markets such as in the Northern Triangle (Byrd and Mansﬁ eld 2014, 75). In addition, state responses to crime and preconditions, like the nature of local gang culture, are important factors in assessing the potential escalation of violence (IISS 2011). Like other trends discussed in this chapter, TOC needs to be addressed at national, regional, and global levels.

{"page": 107, "text": "The Need for Prevention in an Interdependent World 71 As discussed in chapter 3, prevention rests on the incentives of actors to choose behavior leading toward peace rather than violence and to limit the harm done by actors who choose violence. This under- standing is particularly relevant in relation to the risks posed by TOC. At the country and regional levels, focus should be placed not only on changing the incentives of actors operating in areas where transna- tional organized crime is present, but also on ﬁ ghting corruption within the state and reinforcing its accountability prerequisites for action to be effective. The security and justice sector is particularly crucial in this regard. It is also important to ensure that no geographic areas are left out of an accountable and positive governance sys- tem, because TOC preys on vulnerable areas, including those far from the center or difﬁ cult to reach regions with low den- sity, urban slums where the state is absent, and any area with weak governance. Addressing TOC requires working with the community, as many organized crime net- works are entrenched in the communities themselves.

The world is at once more interconnected and interdependent than ever, which means that many countries acutely feel the stresses of global changes like population movements, climate change, advancements in new technologies, and shifting patterns of governance. Now there is pressure on global institu- tions and individual societies to improve their management of the risks and opportunities that arise as a result of so many concurrent, interlinked, and impactful global trends. The current international system, both states and multilateral institutions, has been dedicated to preventing interstate war and, increasingly, intrastate conﬂ ict. But the changing nature of warfare and violence (as shown in chapter 1) and the changes in transnational phenomena and the global landscape (described here) warrant a different approach. With several opportunities for peace, as well as risks for violence, global collaboration is critical. Speciﬁ cally, it requires working at national, regional, and international levels together, as no country alone can manage the risks that arise from these trends.

{"page": 113, "text": "Pathways for Peace 77 CHAPTER 3 Pathways for Peace A society’s ability to manage conﬂ ict con- structively is tested continuously by risks that push it toward violence and opportuni- ties to move toward sustainable peace. These challenges emerge from the fast- shifting global and regional landscape, as highlighted in chapter 2, and they reﬂ ect each society’s unique composition. This study views prevention, in line with the United Nations (UN) sustaining peace resolutions (UN General Assembly 2016a; UN Security Council 2016a), as “activities aimed at preventing the outbreak, escala- tion, continuation, and recurrence of con- ﬂ ict, addressing root causes, assisting parties to conﬂ ict to end hostilities, ensuring national reconciliation, and moving towards recovery, reconstruction, and development. ” This chapter presents a framework for understanding prevention as part of a com- prehensive strategy for sustaining peace. Societies are complex systems in which change follows nonlinear trajectories cre- ated by the interaction, decisions, and actions of multiple actors. The framework is based on the concept of pathways for peace and focuses on three core elements of soci- ety: actors, the individuals and groups whose decisions ultimately deﬁ ne the pathway a society takes; institutions, which shape the incentives for peace or violence and therefore inﬂ uence the society’s overall"}
{"page": 113, "text": ", the individuals and groups whose decisions ultimately deﬁ ne the pathway a society takes; institutions, which shape the incentives for peace or violence and therefore inﬂ uence the society’s overall capacity to mitigate conﬂ ict; and structural factors, which are the foundational elements of a society that deﬁ ne its organization and constitute the overall environment in which actors make decisions. Violent conﬂ ict cannot be adequately understood using state-centric perspectives because, as discussed in chapters 1 and 2, many of the world’s violent conﬂ icts take place on the peripheries of, or outside, the community of states and do not involve government soldiers. Instead, conﬂ icts involving a variety of actors, structures, and processes are playing out at multiple levels, with governments and partners increasingly challenged with identifying and addressing risks, simultaneously, but to varying degrees, at local, national, regional, and global levels. The concept of pathways for peace helps to illustrate how the risk of violence and the opportunities for peace emerge and change over time. It is possible for a single event to cause an abrupt shift in a society’s pathway; however, in most cases pathways change rel- atively slowly, as risks intensify, accumulate, or are mitigated.

{"page": 113, "text": "er, in most cases pathways change rel- atively slowly, as risks intensify, accumulate, or are mitigated. Underlying risks related to the exclusion of particular groups—for example, based on identity or geography— tend to play a role in most violent conﬂ icts. While the calculus of actors is driven strongly by incentives in the short term, the incentives to use violence may accumulate or dissipate over months, years, or even decades. Often violence exists in different forms before being recognized and labeled as a violent conﬂ ict. In some cases, actions result in violence even when this is not the preferred outcome of any single actor."}
{"page": 114, "text": "78 Pathways for Peace The pathways for peace framework allows for the identiﬁ cation of entry points over time for efforts to address risks and take advantage of opportunities for peace. In line with the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the UN sustaining peace resolutions, prevention in this model requires a constant process of mitigating shocks, while making sustained investments to reduce underlying structural and institu- tional risks. A Framework for Peaceful Pathways A society’s pathway moves through a vari- ety of situations that present risks and opportunities for maintaining a peaceful path (ﬁ gure 3.1). These pathways are never linear. In the words of North, Wallis, and Weingast (2009, 12), “The dynamism of social order is a dynamic of change, not a dynamic of progress. Most societies move backward and forward with respect to polit- ical and economic development. ” Because they are shaped by the complex relation- ships among the core elements of society, the pathways are extremely difﬁ cult to predict. Pathways move through a myriad of situations. The ideal state of affairs, shown as the darker shade of green in ﬁ gure 3.1, can be understood as sustainable peace, a situation without violence and built on sus- tainable development, justice, equity, and protection of human rights as deﬁ ned in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 1 The opposing situatio"}

Between sustainable peace and overt vio- lence is a range of situations where risks to peace and violence manifest together. Some of these situations can be quite stable and predictable, in the sense that a certain power equilibrium is maintained (Galtung 1969) and there is an apparent absence of tension (King 1963, 1). Y et, such situations do not constitute sustainable peace as long as underlying tensions remain unaddressed or actively suppressed (World Bank 2011). At times, temporary bargains have helped to stave off overt violence in the short term, potentially buying time for broader reforms that can direct a pathway toward more sustained peace. For example, the increase in public sector employment in the Arab Republic of Egypt and Tunisia in FIGURE 3.1 Pathway between Sustainable Peace and Violent Conflict 1 YEARPRESENT 5 YEARS 10 YEARS Sustainable peace Violent conﬂict Inclusionary process Regional instability Center-periphery arrangement Mounting grievances and repression Societies forge unique pathways as they negotiate competing pressures pushing toward violent conﬂict and sustainable peace.

Some societies have exited violent conﬂ ict and transitioned into long periods during which conﬂ icts are suppressed by force more than resolved. Y et, this relative stability does not equate with sustainable peace. Thus, the lack of open violence should not be con- fused with peace but rather understood as conditions of varying risk. Sudden changes in a pathway are rela- tively rare. Instead, cross-country studies of violent conﬂ ict have consistently demon- strated that some societies appear particu- larly vulnerable to violence, with histories characterized by either prolonged violence or repeated episodes of violence, while others tend to be resilient and experience protracted periods of peace (Jones, Elgin- Cossart, and Esberg 2012). Min et al. (2017), relying on the Armed Conﬂ ict Dataset of Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), reviewed data for 161 countries during the 1995–2015 period and found that violent conﬂ ict is often cyclical or episodic and that vulnerability to violence relates less to speciﬁ c shocks than to slow-changing insti- tutional and structural factors. Similarly, Fearon and Laitin (2013) examined data for all countries over the 1816–2007 period, ﬁ nding that violent conﬂ ict"}

Similarly, Fearon and Laitin (2013) examined data for all countries over the 1816–2007 period, ﬁ nding that violent conﬂ ict tends to con- centrate and persist in certain countries 2 and, conversely, that a large set of countries, roughly 60, did not experience violent conﬂ ict at all. Given the global trends discussed in chapter 1, this pattern can be expected to continue. A relatively small number of countries experience violent conﬂ ict at any given time. That said, risks of conﬂ ict will remain high in many countries as long as underlying drivers are not addressed and systemic risks continue to intensify, with the potential for new conﬂ icts to break out and existing conﬂ icts to become protracted or internationalized (Dupuy et al. 2017). Efforts to encourage peaceful pathways continue to be critical both in ending vio- lence as well as in reducing the risk to these countries of violence breaking out. The pathways concept is applicable at multiple levels—that is, to speciﬁ c areas within a country or areas that extend beyond the borders of a single country. It aids in understanding the risks and oppor- tunities around subregional conﬂ ict and in regions like the Sahel, where risks and opportunities are linked across countries.

{"page": 115, "text": "tunities around subregional conﬂ ict and in regions like the Sahel, where risks and opportunities are linked across countries. These different levels, although often treated as separate, are in reality ﬂ uid and interlinked. In an increasingly interdepen- dent world, risks intersect across levels. In the same way, pathways, in principle, also exist at different levels. A key analytical challenge is to deﬁ ne the boundaries between the levels and the relative weight that should be assigned to them, which Williams terms the “level of analysis prob- lem” (Williams 2016, 43). Recognizing this challenge, the frame- work presented in this study takes the national-level pathway as the dominant path, highlighting the centrality of the state in determining national outcomes. The framework underscores that the different levels formally intersect through the rights and responsibilities of the state. The state has local, national, and international responsibilities, and the failure of the state in those responsibilities can fuel the spread of conﬂ ict across borders. The focus on national pathways does not mean a focus solely on state institutions, but rather a focus on the national level of analysis, in which the state is a key actor, as discussed later in this chapter.

A key variable in this analysis is, therefore, the capacity of a state to govern risks across levels within its territory. The framework for this study under- stands societies as comprising three core elements—actors, institutions, and struc- tural factors—whose interactions inﬂ uence the pathway a society takes (ﬁ gure 3.2). The pathway that a society takes is a product of the decisions of critical actors, who are enabled or constrained by struc- tural factors and inﬂ uenced by the institu- tions that help to deﬁ ne the incentives for their behavior. T o understand how path- ways are forged, it is critical to examine the interactions among these three elements."}
{"page": 116, "text": "80 Pathways for Peace Because they operate in relationship to one another, a shift in one will have impacts on the others. Structural factors are the foundational elements of society that determine its essen- tial organization. They include, for example, geography, economic systems, political structures, demographic composition, or distribution of resources. In general, struc- tural factors do not change easily, and when they do, they do so only over relatively long periods of time. Structural factors shape the overall environment in which actors make decisions. As highlighted in chapter 2, they may include systemic stresses, such as the inﬂ uence of transnational illicit markets or the impacts of climate change. Some structural factors are more mallea- ble than others. For example, geography can rarely be altered, although societies can ﬁ nd ways to mitigate its impacts (Fearon and Laitin 2013; Raleigh and Urdal 2007), as reﬂ ected in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 of the 2030 Agenda. High levels of aid dependence and excessive reliance on natural resources for economic growth tend to be associated with greater risk of violence and can usually be changed only over lon- ger periods of time (Blattman and Miguel 2010; Collier and Hoefﬂ er 2004; OECD 2016).

In the social realm, structural factors such as legacies of violence, trauma, and the societal divisions left by violence, can per- sist over generations and often take signiﬁ - cant effort and time to change (Hegre and Sambanis 2006; Volkan 2004; World Bank 2011). Conversely, societies that possess more cohesion, higher income levels, more inclusive economic and political regimes, a more diversiﬁ ed economy, and a history of peaceful cooperation across groups and that are located in more stable regions expe- rience less violence (Collier et al. 2003; Easterly, Ritzen, and Woolcock 2006; Østby 2008; Parks, Colletta, and Oppenheim 2013; Stewart 2004, 2008, 2010). While structural factors are clear inﬂ u- ences on the overall health of a society, institutions have been described as the “immune system, ” charged with defending a society from pressures toward violence and promoting overall resilience (World Bank 2011, 72). Just as a healthy immune system mounts a quick, targeted response to FIGURE 3.2 Actors, Structural Factors, Institutions ACTORS INSTITUTIONS STRUCTURAL FACTORS INSTITUTIONS provide the “rules of the game,” both formal, legal frameworks and informal social norms and values that can determine actors’ behavior, incentives, and capacity to work together.

Institutions provide the “rules of the game”—both formal legal frameworks and informal social norms and values—that govern actors’ behavior and limit the dam- age that individual actors can do (North 1990, 3). Formal law enforcement institu- tions do this directly, by capturing and con- taining individuals who behave violently. Informal social norms also perform this role, by inﬂ uencing people’s expectations about how other people will behave. If indi- viduals believe that others are obeying the laws and rules of society, they are more likely to do so as well. However, if an indi- vidual does not have solid reason to expect that rules will be enforced, the payoffs to violence are higher. In these cases, ineffec- tive institutions can enable—rather than contain—behavior that threatens societal well-being. The larger a society, the greater the number of institutions (as “enforcers” of rules) needed (North, Wallis, and Weingast 2009). In deﬁ ning the “rules” for actors’ behavior, institutions shape the overall incentive structure for peace.

In “Somaliland, ” trusted governing bodies that encompass actors from various sectors, including clan leaders and elders, have contributed to more than two decades of relative stability and peace, despite ongoing violent conﬂ ict in southern Somalia (World Bank 2017). The longer peace endures, the greater the disincentives for any of the groups to resort to violence. Institutions also structure incentives by managing the expectations of actors. One of the key tasks of institutions is to temper the sense of relative deprivation and frus- trated expectations of groups who do not see themselves as beneﬁ ting fairly from overall economic advancement and ensur- ing that these frustrations are addressed peacefully (Gurr 1970; Huntington 1968). As more countries shift toward open political systems, they raise expectations about access to certain freedoms and services. As discussed in more detail in chapter 4, grievances across groups can arise if expectations remain unmet due to constrained resources or lack of political will (Brinkerhoff 2011).

Rather than being conﬁ ned to the inﬂ uence of individual leaders or special interest groups, they possess sufﬁ cient depth to include diverse groups in a society and have the staying power to outlast political terms or temporary agreements between elites (World Bank 2011). This generates trust in the institutions themselves, even when peo- ple do not feel trust or legitimacy toward a particular leader representing that institu- tion. In this way, the impersonal nature of effective institutions can produce a legiti- mizing effect, which is itself an incentive for maintaining peace and stability. Effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels are an explicit goal within the 2030 Agenda. T o some degree, inclusive institutions can also protect against the impact of unfa- vorable structural factors, for example, by embodying greater voice and accountability in decision making or redistribution of resources (Fearon and Laitin 2013; Raleigh and Urdal 2007).

Actors are the central component of this framework. Actors can include individuals (especially inﬂ uential leaders), social groups, or small organizations who make decisions in competition or cooperation with one another.

Actors’ behaviors, in turn, shape the incentives for other actors to choose vio- lence or peace. For example, as chapter 4 highlights, leaders may develop narratives that increase the incentives for violence or promote peace. The boundaries between organizations of actors and institutions are difﬁ cult to deﬁ ne. At what point does a group of people, acting together, become an institution? For the purposes of this framework, institutions are understood as possessing a level of structure that transcends personal relation- ships, with rules and norms that apply broadly to all constituents. An organization of actors becomes an institution when it establishes norms and rules that go beyond the immediate inﬂ uence of one or a few members. Some organizations and even some states are in reality not institutions if they are effectively controlled by a small group of individuals or the rules or norms are not endorsed or followed by the major- ity of citizens. They do not provide what an institution is supposed to provide, and the small group of individuals may not repre- sent the interests of all social groups, deep- ening the perception that an organization is exclusionary by design.

The army has been poorly trained and equipped and lacks cohesiveness and leadership. This has created a security vacuum in various parts of the country, especially the border region. • Decentralization, a central factor in giving the regions more autonomy, has been marred by corruption and lack of accountability of local politicians. It has also upset the ethnic balance. Additionally, political decentralization has never been well accepted by the central government bureaucracy. • Competition among clans and families has weakened traditional institutions regulating the Tuareg and Fulani groups. Youth, in particular, do not have effective means of participating in these institutions, contributing to a loss in moral authority. (Box continued next page)"}
{"page": 119, "text": "Pathways for Peace 83 Path Dependency of Violence All societies experience some violence. Y et, high-intensity violent conﬂ ict is a relatively rare phenomenon; most societies are at peace most of the time. Being at peace brings a certain inertia; societies at peace tend to remain at peace. The longer and more intentionally a society has worked to address structural factors and create the incentives for peace, the harder it is to derail that society from a peaceful path. Episodes of violence, nevertheless, can happen at any point along the pathway, even when the path is headed in the direc- tion of peace. Violence tends to emerge more gradually than is often assumed, with risks building up over periods of months and years (box 3.2). Like peace, violence is highly path- dependent. As violent conﬂ ict continues, societies can get caught in a “conﬂ ict trap, ” where incentives are reconﬁ gured in ways that sustain conﬂ ict, and many actors—the state, private sector, communities—start to organize themselves with the view that violent conﬂ ict will continue (Collier et al. 2003, 1). As discussed in chapter 1, many of today’s conﬂ icts are more pro- tracted and involve an increasing number of armed groups, including self-defense militias, rebel groups, illicit trafﬁ cking networks, and urban gangs.

The “original causes” often evolve and transform as new generations of actors get involved and as war economies become more entrenched (Bøås 2015; Wolff, Ross, and Wee 2017). Over time, violent conﬂ ict can deepen grievances and divisions between groups. These emotional legacies can be transferred from generation to generation to justify continued violence. In addition, social norms meant to limit violence often relax, as violence becomes normalized as a means of resolving conﬂ ict or enforcing power relationships. Women and children are par- ticularly affected by these dynamics, as vio- lence against them tends to become more common and more brutal as conﬂ ict con- tinues (Boudet et al. 2012; Crespo-Sancho 2017; Kelly 2017; Slegh, Barker, and Levtov 2014). Because of the way these psychoso- cial impacts accumulate, even building the “right” institutions cannot ensure a linear path out of conﬂ ict (World Bank 2017).

Politicians and leaders of armed groups have little incentive to push for a comprehensive peace deal. • Persistent instrumentalization of ethnicity through the use of community-based militias triggers intercommunal conﬂ icts and fuels resentment toward the central state. • Daily insecurity, terrorism, and lack of trust toward regular security forces push people to take responsibility for their own security and justice and to seek protection from various armed groups. • Weapons have become more available since the 2011 crisis in Libya.

The need to prioritize security often results in large security forces that are difﬁ cult to demobilize and reintegrate later. Trust and legitimacy in state institutions can be eroded, as people lose faith in insti- tutions that cannot protect them or provide the basic services they need. Protracted con- ﬂ ict also fuels the brain drain of national talent and skills, as those with the means to do so look for opportunities elsewhere. Even after violence has taken root, it is still possible for societies to change course. Intermittently along the pathways, oppor- tunities appear when actors’ decisions have more impact to deﬁ ne a pathway. These “transition moments” are events that open up the possibility for a marked change in direction (ﬁ gure 3.3)—for example, a national political transition, a new leader in BOX 3.2 Violent Conflict Emerges and Escalates over Time Overall, outbreaks and cycles of violence are rare.

The model predicts that the average likelihood of a country at peace transitioning to an outbreak is 2.3 percent for a lower- intensity conﬂ ict (deﬁ ned as 25–999 battle deaths a year) and just 0.09 percent for a civil war. As risks build and accumulate, the probability of violence increases, but not as quickly as often assumed. Only 4 percent of countries at peace are likely to escalate to either a high-risk conﬂ ict (in which an early warning system warns of an outbreak of violence) or a low-intensity conﬂ ict in a given year. Of countries already at high risk, 11 percent are likely to transition to a high-intensity conﬂ ict (1,000 or more battle deaths a year). Once violence takes root, however, the likelihood it will continue is relatively high. In 78 percent of cases, the ﬁ rst year of civil war is followed by a second year of war. Risk continues to be high even after violence has stopped; in the ﬁ rst year of recovery after civil war, the likelihood of relapse is 18 percent.

During transition moments, coalitions can be formed, leadership demonstrated, and reforms launched. In most cases, a peaceful pathway results from actions taken in many transition moments, rather than a single event. However, as risks escalate—and especially after violence has begun— opportunities for transition moments are less frequent. As explored further below, early monitoring of risks helps in identify- ing potential transition moments. The Centrality of Actors As noted throughout this study, the deci- sions, calculations, and leadership shown (or not) by actors ultimately determine the pathways societies take. Actors can shape structural factors and inﬂ uence the way institutions are built and reformed. Understanding the central role that differ- ent actors play in driving conﬂ ict is espe- cially crucial now, given the multiplicity and complexity of the actors involved in violent conﬂ ict today. Actors can change their behavior rela- tively abruptly.

It may take a generation or more to achieve the deeper institutional transfor- mations needed to reach recognized stan- dards of governance like civilian oversight of the military, anticorruption measures, or a functioning state bureaucracy (Pritchett and de Weijer 2010). In most settings, actors tend to make decisions that privilege visible beneﬁ cial impact in the short to medium term over actions that may only bear fruit in the lon- ger term. This is often as true in contexts with democratic systems that require a periodic transfer of power between parties as in less democratic settings where leaders often feel a strong need to maintain popu- lar support. The actions of one individual, or a small group, can bring enormous, often swift, consequences for society. In some cases, just one or a few actors can derail progress toward peace.

Likewise, the decisive actions of particu- lar leaders and small groups can create incentives for peace, helping to push a soci- ety out of a cycle of violence. Leaders can spearhead initiatives that can change a pathway quickly, such as activating coali- tions and invoking or shaping norms and values for prevention. They may provide a long-term vision of a society’s peaceful future that engages a large audience. Taking such actions often involves risk, especially for political leaders, because political capital or even survival may be at stake in the short term. As chapter 6 illustrates, in high-risk or violent situations, it most often falls to indi- vidual leaders to weigh and act on the inev- itable political, social, economic, and security trade-offs that prevention entails and to balance the effects of other actors, institutions, and structural factors.

Actors “think automatically” rather than deliberately (World Bank 2015).

The stress of poverty focuses attention on the present, making it hard to plan for the future, like investing in education, or opening a small business. This “cognitive tax” 3 is exacer- bated in conﬂ ict-affected environments, where the threat or experience of violence combines with the daily challenges of meet- ing basic needs (World Bank 2015, 81). Actors also “think socially, ” that is, they are heavily inﬂ uenced by social norms that determine their expectations about how others will respond to a decision they make. Instead, the behavior of actors is shaped by their social and emotional envi- ronment (Halliday and Shaffer 2015; Simon 1997 [1947]). In this way, social norms help to shape the incentives of actors because they help actors to antici- pate how others will behave. Expectations of shame or loss of reputation, for example, can be more powerful enforcers of con- tracts than legal regulations. Domestic Actors The pathway a society takes depends greatly on the way actors in that society—what this report calls “domestic actors”—cooperate or compete with one another.

Most often, the state is central among them, but a constellation of actors plays roles in various combinations at dif- ferent times. Domestic actors can promote a virtuous cycle of long-term peace and development. For example, community or religious groups and nongovernmental organiza- tions have played pivotal roles in promot- ing and sustaining peace. They can also push a society toward violence. As men- tioned in chapter 1, violent conﬂ ict in recent years is characterized by a prolifera- tion of nonstate actors such as militias, rebel groups, criminal groups, violent extremist groups, and many others. Oftentimes the stated grievances used to justify their movements evolve over time. In addition, these groups do not always rep- resent the interests of the people whom they claim to represent. This is particularly evident in the emergence of criminal net- works operating in contexts of violence.

The range of domestic actors is too vast to treat exhaustively. Here, the chapter focuses on some of the key domestic actors that matter for understanding violence and violence prevention: the state, civil society and community organizations, and the pri- vate sector. The State In most societies, the state is the central domestic actor inﬂ uencing a society’s pathway. While the extent of its agency and power vary vis-à-vis other actors in society, the state ultimately holds respon- sibility for many of the decisions that shape the pathway and has the authority to negotiate and navigate agreements or political settlements, reform institutions, and direct policy.

{"page": 123, "text": "Pathways for Peace 87 As an abstract concept, the “state” com- prises not only the institutions that repre- sent its more formal and “visible” structure, but also the social interactions that create and sustain that structure. The state is not a unitary actor, but an organization of het- erogeneous individuals, all of whom bring varying motivations, interests, and degrees of commitment to shaping the character and functioning of the state. For example, the bureaucrats that make up state institu- tions are driven by a variety of motivations, from a vocation for public service, desire to advance their careers, need to provide for their families or accumulate wealth, as well as political interests. All of these motiva- tions and interests are constantly negoti- ated; they shape, and are shaped by, the institutions that result from them (Marc et al. 2012). The state is a product of its interaction with society and continually evolves in the context of that relationship. Predatory states prey on social groups, extracting resources with little or no compensation. States can be captured or work in collusion with pow- erful interests that undermine peaceful pathways.

Others essentially contract out the delivery of basic services to nonstate actors, such as nonproﬁ t organizations and external partners. Many states—including many in fragile and conﬂ ict-affected contexts— garner support and ensure their existence through informal patronage networks that distribute resources and privileges to key constituencies (Evans 2004). 5 In these cases, political authority is diffuse and informal, rather than formalized through state institutions (Bøås et al. 2017). The relationship between these networks and the state may be quite stable, as long as the power balance is maintained (Brinkerhoff and Goldsmith 2005). Attempts to reform institutions will inevitably bump up against this reality and can lead to instability when the balance of power across groups is dis- rupted (Hameiri 2007).

These spaces are not necessarily limited to a deﬁ ned geographic area. The Internet, for instance, has been described as an ungoverned space because it offers an unregulated, virtual haven and a platform for recruiting to violent extremist groups (Patrick 2010). In reality, ungoverned spaces are not so much ungoverned as alternatively governed. In many cases, they represent populations on the political or geographic peripheries of a country that have never been meaningfully integrated into state-building projects. Where the state is absent or unwilling to assert its presence, other actors step into the void.

These actors may provide state-like services such as security, employment, and educa- tion, as armed groups have done in contexts ranging from the Philippines to Afghanistan, Jamaica, and cities in Brazil (Arias 2013; Clunan and Trinkunas 2010; Keister 2014; Sacks 2009). Alternatively governed spaces can pres- ent a challenge to sustainable peace when the presence and activities of nonstate actors undermine state capacity and legiti- macy (Nezam 2017).

When these groups are able to establish control and set up parallel state struc- tures, especially when they deliver secu- rity that the state cannot, or will not, deliver, the state loses credibility and its capacity is undermined.

The chief concern has been that alternatively governed spaces may facilitate the entry and operations of nonstate actors such as illicit trafﬁ cking networks, gangs, or violent extremist groups (Clunan and Trinkunas 2010; Keister 2014; Nezam 2017). While weak state presence is often an attractive condition for these actors, it is insufﬁ cient on its own. Criminal and extremist groups require a certain level of infrastructure (transport and communications, in particular) as well as some support from local populations, in order to operate effectively. For this reason, weak states may be more vulnerable than failed states to these types of networks (Menkhaus and Shapiro 2010). All three forms of alternative governance ultimately undermine state capacity and legitimacy, even though they may bring some stability over the short term. The presence of these spaces also offers varying degrees of opportunity to integrate them into broader society by increasing the representation of local populations in the arenas where access to power, resources, and security are negotiated. Chapter 5 discusses these issues in greater detail. BOX 3.3 Alternatively Governed Spaces (continued)"}

In some cases, elites may discount actions whose consequences, while grave, are not immediate and clear, in order to ensure regime survival. In other cases, the state may lack the requisite legitimacy in the eyes of particular groups to address underlying risks. Capacity is another factor; states that are unable to formulate and implement policies, collect taxes, provide basic services, or ensure a minimum of security are often limited in the extent to which they can monitor and address risks. A particular effort is needed to support the capacity of countries experiencing situations of fragil- ity so that they can more effectively under- take prevention policies and programs and implement the 2030 Agenda, which pro- vides a pathway to sustainable development and peace. Civil Society and Community- Based Organizations Civil society actors comprise a wide range of associations and nonstate entities, including charities, nongovernmental orga- nizations, community groups, faith-based organizations, trade guilds and unions, professional associations, and advocacy groups, among others (Aslam 2017; Marc et al. 2012).

The category also includes informal decision-making bodies, such as tribal councils or elders, that provide many of the basic services to people in transition or postconﬂ ict settings (UNDP 2012). While civil society is often seen as consist- ing of organizations that may be competing for the same pool of resources, their under- lying norms and values have been assumed to be largely shared, facilitating potential broad-based solidarity. With an increasing multiplicity and diversity of actors engag- ing in the civic space, this space is also becoming a more contested domain of public life (Poppe and Wolff 2017). In addi- tion, civic space has received a digital dimension, which provides space for differ- ent modes of both solidarity and contesta- tion (Dahlgren 2015). Civil society actors can promote conﬁ - dence and build trust, which encourages cooperation among members of society and creates incentives for collective action. Where trust is forged across groups, it can apply to society more broadly (Boix and Posner 1996; Y amagishi and Y amagishi 1994). This ability to build bottom-up trust gives civil society an instrumental role in forming coalitions for peace.

At the most basic level, civil society actors may help to provide basic services to local communities, an important function in maintaining stability during a crisis. Civic associations, such as neighborhood or com- munity organizations, often contribute to cohesion that helps to buffer against risk of violence, especially when they build rela- tionships across different social groups (Aslam 2017; Varshney 2002). Civil society groups also play an important role in pro- moting social norms that discourage vio- lence, for example, by increasing awareness of the costs of violent conﬂ ict and showcas- ing opportunities that can come from engagement across rival groups (Barnes 2009). Beyond these roles, civil society organi- zations (CSOs) play a crucial part in medi- ating the state-society relationship by maintaining space for dialogue and expres- sion of dissent (Marc et al. 2012). CSOs, in many cases, play a role in holding the state accountable, which becomes increasingly important in high-risk situations, when the space for dialogue often narrows (Chenoweth and Stephan 2011), including to ensure that the state implements interna- tional agreements such as the 2030 Agenda.

Chapter 6 covers the experiences of civil society actors in shaping societies’ pathways in more detail. As with all actors, the role of CSOs has its limitations and is not uniformly posi- tive or effective. Many actors make a transi- tion from civil society to operate in state institutions or move to civil society after their role in the government. These career paths often facilitate better relations between state institutions and communi- ties, but can also damage the perception of independence. Where CSOs are insufﬁ - ciently independent or represent narrow interest groups, they can cause more harm than good in the absence of appropriate countervailing forces. CSOs can also contribute to division when they exclude other groups, either unintentionally or by design. CSOs can use their grassroots appeal and convening power as a way to mobilize for violence against other groups. For instance, before the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, CSOs includ- ing the Hutu Power groups excluded parts of the population and tended not to cross group divides, and some community orga- nizations were active in the genocide (Aslam 2017; Human Rights Watch 1999; UN General Assembly and UN Security Council 1999).

By building intergroup cohesion and “perverse social capital” that isolates them from other social groups, CSOs can also work to counter positive social goals (Posner 2004). This methodology is present in groups as diverse as urban gangs, para- military organizations, and student associa- tions that became the ﬁ rst vigilante groups active during the 2002 conﬂ ict in Côte d’Ivoire (Sany 2010). Private Sector Actors Private enterprises have been an integral part of society for millennia and play an important role in shaping peaceful path- ways. The private sector is a primary source of livelihoods for the majority of the population today as well as an import- ant avenue by which to foster inclusion and social cohesion. Private enterprises, both formal and informal, have the ﬂ exibility to provide jobs, services, and tax revenue, as well as public goods such as infrastructure and enhanced environmen- tal and governance standards, all of which shape incentives for maintaining peace. In addition, by supporting markets, the private sector enables interaction across social groups and communities that helps to build trust—a critical ingredient for prevention.

Small and medium enterprises can be collec- tively powerful in shaping peace incen- tives by contributing to social and economic interactions and attracting and making investments that are conducive to peace. They play an important role as ﬂ exible, adaptable entities. Large domes- tic and multinational ﬁ rms can act as a major force for peace too. Leadership from businesses—setting examples of conduct, developing standards, negotiat- ing concessions, and consolidating inter- national partnerships—can go a long way toward mitigating tensions.

Some of these experiences are described in more detail in chapter 6."}

Just as private sector actors can help shape peaceful pathways, they can also contribute to and beneﬁ t from violent conﬂ ict (Peschka 2011). When con- ﬂ ict starts, individual companies or groups of companies may seek to proﬁ t from the opportunities that conﬂ ict provides, for instance, by trafﬁ cking or trading in weap- ons and other goods with various armed factions (Comolli 2017). In some cases, pri- vate companies have become embroiled directly in conﬂ ict by supporting trade in minerals that may be trafﬁ cked by armed groups (Campbell 2002; Rettberg 2015). Corporations can also contribute to griev- ances and tensions through land grabs for agriculture, extractives, or commercial projects, while large-scale mining compa- nies have fed into conﬂ icts in Bougainville and Samoa. The proliferation of private security companies and private military ﬁ rms in recent decades has also raised ques- tions of conﬂ icts of interest, as in some cases these ﬁ rms have contributed to under- mining state capacity to control violence and citizen trust in state law enforcement (Singer 2010).

The interaction of businesses with other actors in a given institutional con- text determines to a large extent their impact on conﬂ ict dynamics. For this rea- son, transparency, on the one hand, and accountability, on the other hand, are crit- ical for fostering a positive contribution of the private actors to peace; these issues are elaborated in chapter 6. Voluntary standards play a similarly crit- ical role in that respect. Conﬂ ict-sensitive business practices have gathered momen- tum as a way for private companies to carry out their activities with a commit- ment to do-no-harm principles (UN Global Compact 2017). Operating in a conﬂ ict-sensitive manner is a preventive strategy deeply rooted in understanding the local context. Lack of such understanding stands to aggravate local tensions uninten- tionally by disproportionally employing staff from one community or another, pro- viding revenue or capacity that can later be deployed in conﬂ icts.

International Actors While domestic actors drive change on the ground, international actors have a strong role to play, primarily in helping to shape the incentives and actions of national actors. International actors include national governments external to the conﬂ ict, regional organizations, the private sector, 6 and the multilateral system of political, security, and development institutions. Their actions can be decisive, especially where domestic actors are too fractured, inclined by their own interests or history, or incapable of acting.

In other cases, international actors con- tribute indirectly to the forces pushing toward violence, by failing to understand their own role in conﬂ ict dynamics. International actors bring their own expec- tations and ideas of what domestic action should look like, which are in turn shaped by their individual experiences and back- grounds. It can be difﬁ cult for international actors to “see” domestic institutions and relationships, especially if they are cultur- ally and socially different from their own. This tension between formal struc- tures, which are often more visible and understood by international actors, and the (usually) informal institutions and norms that govern daily life for much of society inﬂ uences every aspect of the involvement of international actors: from who gets invited to the table for decision making to the information international actors receive and how international support is priori- tized and directed. International actors can help to neutralize the impact of their pres- ence by being aware of the biases they bring and the makeup of the society they are enter- ing (Barron, Woolcock, and Diprose 2011).

Regional actors have provided channels for navigating the effects of systemic risks such as broader political and economic trends and global issues such as trade, climate change, trans- national crime or terrorism, or natural disasters. They also are taking more active roles in conﬂ ict mitigation and prevention. Regional actors are likely to have deeper interests in the outcomes, to have greater understanding of and interest in regional stability, and therefore to be seen as more legitimate mediators or conveners than multilateral actors. Countries at risk of vio- lent conﬂ ict also are often more receptive to talking to neighbors and governments from the same region. However, regional actors are not without challenges. Regional orga- nizations’ mandates, capacity, and resources do not always match the demand for their support, or they may be perceived as partial toward certain actors.

Following on the principle of state sovereignty, as enshrined in the mandates and procedural rules of international orga- nizations, international actors require an interlocutor at the national level in order to operate in any environment. This is almost always the national government. In turn, national governments may depend on inter- national actors to supply the resources and in some cases technical capacity to ensure regime survival. This support can take many forms, including strengthening the security apparatus or targeted delivery of public ser- vices to certain constituencies on which the regime depends. The terms of this mutually dependent relationship represent constraints on the agency of both parties, to differing degrees (Barnett and Zurcher 2010; Bøås et al. 2017). National governments encounter limits on the degree to which they can maintain stabil- ity through coercion and repression, lest they risk losing the external ﬁ nancial or military support that allows them to sustain power. Additionally, they must balance the demands of the constituencies that keep them in power with the requirements for international support.

This dual accountability represents a critical dilemma for many states, especially when the nature of the demands makes it impossible to satisfy expectations from both international and domestic consistencies simultaneously (Englebert and Tüll 2008; Ghani and Lockhart 2008). In turn, international actors’ reliance on states as interlocutors for conﬂ ict preven- tion limits their room for maneuver, since their presence depends on the discretion of national governments. Any support they provide happens relative to the state’s rela- tionship with the constituencies that main- tain it.

In the process, international actors frequently opt for reinforcing these networks—especially when the state main- tains them with minimal repression—over pressuring for the long-term reforms needed to ensure greater inclusion. Chapter 6 explores this dilemma further. Understanding Risk and Opportunity Different points along the pathways exhibit varying degrees of risk and present opportunities. The concept of risk has been well developed in the ﬁ elds of disaster risk management and ﬁ nance. It is generally understood as the probability of an event combined with the severity of its impact if it does occur (Hammond and Hyslop 2017, 17–18; UN General Assembly 2016b). Risk is mediated by the capacity to manage it. A central premise of the World Development Report 2011 is that the capacity of institu- tions provides the necessary buffer for soci- eties to manage risk and navigate conﬂ ict without violence (World Bank 2011). Sometimes, risks can be relatively iso- lated.

Recent studies have looked at the intersection of risks related to climate change and violent conﬂ ict (Schleussner et al. 2016; von Uexkulla et al. 2016). Some authors have drawn a relation between the drought in Syria and the beginning of the uprising. Beginning in 2005 and intensifying through the winter of 2006–07, the Fertile Crescent region witnessed the worst drought in its recorded history (Kelleya et al. 2015). There is very strong evidence that the drought resulted from anthropogenic climate change. The drought, which lasted more than ﬁ ve years with peak intensity during the ﬁ rst three, was an extreme event; however, longer-term trends toward warming, reduction of soil moisture, and decreases in precipitation in the Fertile Crescent are also consistent with climate change dynamics in the region.

Agriculture in the northeastern region of Syria—the breadbasket of the country, producing two-thirds of its total cereal output— collapsed. In 2008, during the driest winter in the country’s recorded history, wheat production failed and almost all the livestock was lost. Food prices more than doubled between 2007 and 2008. Unable to afford food, the population in the northeast provinces of Syria experienced a dramatic increase in nutrition-related diseases, and school enrollment dropped by 80 percent in some areas. It is claimed that as many as 1.5 million people were internally displaced in Syria as a result of the drought. Along with many Iraqi refugees ﬂ eeing from the war across the border, the population gravitated to peripheral urban areas. By 2010, 20 percent of Syria’s urban population was composed of internally displaced persons and Iraqi refugees. Bereft of options other than illegal settlement and confronted by a combination of overcrowding, an absence of access to basic services, and rampant crime, these peripheral urban areas became the locus of grievances against the state.

A drought can exacerbate food insecurity, which by itself may be manageable. However, if the risk posed by the drought combines with other risks—loss of livelihoods, perceived discrimination in the state response, or the presence of armed groups who can mobilize grievances—the overall risk of violence increases. The more risks are present or the more intense the risks are, the more they can strain the capacity of a society to respond effectively. All along the pathways, societies expe- rience shocks of different types. A shock is a neutral event. It can be understood sim- ply as a change in the world that brings consequences of some kind (Hammond and Hyslop 2017). A shock may occur sud- denly, in the form of a price spike, for example, or could unfold over time, such as a drought. Most of the time, capable institutions weather shocks and a society stays on a peaceful path. However, in situations where risk is already high or multiple risks are present, shocks can act as triggers by causing a particular effect, such as violence. In these cases, the presence of multiple risks—or very intense risks—and a sudden shock overwhelms the capacity to manage them and triggers violence (box 3.5).

Studies examining the relationship between economic shocks and violent conﬂ ict yield mixed ﬁ ndings. Min et al.

Similarly, in a study of 44 countries in Africa, Aguirre (2016) found that commodity price shocks had a signiﬁ cant effect on the onset of conﬂ ict. Similarly, Calì and Mulabdic (2017), in a study of developing countries between 1960 and 2010, found that an increase in a country’s export prices increased the risk of intrastate conﬂ ict. However, Bazzi and Blattman (2014), in a global, longitudinal study of all low- and middle-income countries from 1957 to 2007, found that price shocks—even intense shocks in high-risk countries—had no signiﬁ cant effect on outbreak of conﬂ ict, but did have a mild, negative impact in countries where violent conﬂ ict was ongoing.

{"page": 130, "text": "s—even intense shocks in high-risk countries—had no signiﬁ cant effect on outbreak of conﬂ ict, but did have a mild, negative impact in countries where violent conﬂ ict was ongoing. Three main theories guide the literature in this area. The “rapacity effect” theory posits that a sharp increase in the price of exports, especially capital-intensive products such as extractives, sparks violence because the beneﬁ ts of the increase can be more easily appropriated (Bazzi and Blattman 2014). Calì and Mulabdic (2017) ﬁ nd support for this theory, as violence in their sample is more likely to be associated with increases in the price of natural resource exports. Others have argued that whether increased rents provide incentive for violence depends on the extent to which the state can control access to them (the “state-deterrence theory”). If the state exerts control over resources, a price rise generates increased tax revenue, whereas if state control is weak, nonstate armed groups have greater incentive to appropriate resources (Dube and Vargas 2013; Fearon and Laitin 2003). According to the “opportunity cost” theory, economic shocks lower the risk of conﬂ ict by increasing the opportunity cost of participating in violence (Collier and Hoefﬂ er 2004; Dal Bo and Dal Bo 2011). This is especially the case with changes in the price of agricultural products, which are more labor-intensive."}

A study of the relationship between rainfall and civil conﬂ ict in 41 African countries between 1981 and 1999 con- cludes that civil conﬂ ict is more likely to occur following years of poor rainfall (Miguel, Satyanath, and Sergenti 2004). If shocks occur when conﬂ ict is already under way, they can exacerbate or prolong it (Bazzi and Blattman 2014). The risks that societies face along their pathways can be exogenous or endogenous. Some exogenous risks arise from the sys- temic trends detailed in chapter 2, including climate change, advancements in informa- tion and communication technology (ICT), demographic shifts, or the increase in illicit trafﬁ cking. While these risks may originate outside national borders, they exert power- ful impacts on national dynamics. As noted in chapter 1, a key exogenous risk is that an increasing number of con- ﬂ icts are internationalized, involving the direct assistance of an external state actor. In these situations, the knowledge that out- side actors can, or might, intervene at any time inﬂ uences the incentives of domestic actors to commit to peace or to disrupt sta- bility (World Bank 2011).

Spillover effects of conﬂ ict from neighbor- ing countries pose additional risks, including direct incursions from armed groups, increased availability of arms, disruption of trade, and sudden and heavy ﬂ ows of refu- gees across borders, among others (Min et al. 2017; World Bank 2011). These risks are more likely to overwhelm the capacity to mitigate them when other endogenous risks are pres- ent. In Central Africa, armed groups have exploited areas of weak governance to set up bases, recruit new members, and take advan- tage of looting opportunities (Raleigh et al. 2010). Likewise, extremist groups have often exploited the existence of internal divisions between identity groups and the lack of con- sistent or credible state presence to gain terri- tory and support from local populations (ICG 2016). As another example, interna- tional illicit trafﬁ cking networks often capital- ize on internal instability, buying off elites or offering ﬁ nancing to armed groups in exchange for the freedom to operate with impunity (Comolli 2017). Institutional capacity can mitigate the impact of exogenous risks.

This effect is enhanced levels of violence in municipalities where landowners sought to appropriate oil rents (Dube and Vargas 2013). Economic shocks are more likely to trigger violence when they are not accompanied by mitigation measures. For example, Calì and Mulabdic (2017) ﬁ nd that countries with strong trading relationships with neighbor countries are less likely to experience violence associated with price shocks. These beneﬁ ts can be enhanced when accompanied by measures to facilitate trade across borders, such as easing logistics or reducing transaction costs. In some cases, economic shocks put increased pressure on governments to make up for lost resources.

Endogenous risks to peaceful pathways tend to emanate from relationships among actors and often involve the state in some way. Perhaps not surprising, grievances tend to arise in arenas where access to power, resources, and security is negotiated. Chapter 5 includes a rich discussion of these arenas and the risks and opportunities present in them. Some of the most powerful endogenous risks relate to social, economic, and political exclusion of different social groups (box 3.6). Exclusionary systems that are perceived to privilege some groups at the expense of others 8 create fertile ground for violence. This is underscored by a growing body of lit- erature arguing that policies promoting inclusion are a source of stability and legiti- macy (Barnett 2006; Brinkerhoff 2007; Call 2008; Chesterman, Ignatieff, and Thakur 2004; Fukuyama 2004; Ghani and Lockhart 2008; Keating and Knight 2004; Stewart et al. 2006).

These ﬁ ndings build on prior work by Fearon (2010) and Fearon and Laitin (2013) emphasizing the importance of inclusive governance to mitigating the risk of conﬂ ict. Gender inclusion, in particular, shows a robust, empirical relationship with peace, from the local to the international level (Caprioli and Tumbore 2003; Caprioli et al. 2007; Herbert 2017; Hudson et al. 2009). Governments of countries with more equi- table gender relations, as measured by levels of violence against women, labor market participation, and income disparities, for example, are signiﬁ cantly less likely to initi- ate interstate conﬂ ict or escalate civil con- ﬂ ict (Hudson et al. 2012).

This study follows the World Bank’s deﬁ nition of inclusion as “the process of improving the ability, opportunity, and dignity of people, disadvantaged on the basis of their identity, to take part in society” (World Bank 2013, 7). This deﬁ nition privileges identity as the source of discrimination, drawing on the work of Stewart (2000, 2002, 2009), which notes that the more rigid identities are in a society, the harder it is for an individual to move across iden- tity groups and the greater the chance f"}

Inclusion of youth also strongly affects a society’s pathway. Societies that offer youth opportunities to participate in the political and economic realms and routes for social mobility tend to experience less violence (Idris 2016; Paasonen and Urdal 2016). With the youth population increas- ing globally, the ability to harness the energy and potential of youth presents a strong opportunity to realize a “demo- graphic dividend” (UN Security Council 2016b). This topic is explored in depth in chapter 4. Other forms of exclusion that heighten the risk of conﬂ ict relate to relationships between central states and populations located on geographic or political peripher- ies within a state. Subnational conﬂ icts of this nature are on the rise in various regions, especially Asia, Europe, and the Middle East as well as Sub-Saharan Africa (Colletta and Oppenheim 2017; Parks, Colletta, and Oppenheim 2013). These conﬂ icts tend to revolve around center-periphery tensions, with a subregion opposing a state-building project or responding to exclusion from political and economic systems.

Center-periphery tensions tend to be rooted in historical patterns of exclusion and are therefore heavily entrenched in state institutions. For a variety of reasons, states often deem the costs of integrating peripheral regions via improved infrastruc- ture or services to be too high for the poten- tial beneﬁ ts it could bring (Keister 2014). Some peripheral regions continue to receive minimal investment as part of colonial leg- acies of neglect of certain areas that were previously buffer zones between rival powers. In many cases, populations in peripheral areas are minorities with strong, separate cultural identities, who were forci- bly incorporated into national structures during moments of state consolidation. In these cases, populations may resist efforts by the state to forge a national identity or to consolidate power as existential threats to ethnic identity (Parks, Colletta, and Oppenheim 2013). Exclusion along center-periphery lines not only fuels conﬂ ict with the state, but also creates fertile ground for other forms of violence to emerge and escalate, includ- ing localized intercommunal and intra-elite violence.

In some cases, center-periphery conﬂ icts have become interlinked with cross-border violence and large-scale inter- nationalized conﬂ icts as well (Colletta and Oppenheim 2017; Parks, Colletta, and Oppenheim 2013). Many peripheral regions fall into the cat- egory of “alternatively governed spaces” as discussed in box 3.3. In these cases, integra- tion efforts can exacerbate instability if they disturb the existing power balances between the vested interests in peripheral regions (Keister 2014). Prevention and Sustaining Peace: Building Peaceful Pathways Understanding the pathways and the ways in which risk and opportunity manifest along them helps to better deﬁ ne prevention. At its core, prevention is the process of inﬂ uencing systems so that it is easier for actors to forge a pathway toward peace, by reinforcing the elements of the system pull- ing toward peace and mitigating the ele- ments that push it toward violent conﬂ ict. This proactive approach is in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the UN sustaining peace resolutions. Consistent with the framework of the World Development Report 2017, prevention requires a rethinking of the process in which state and nonstate actors make decisions and negotiate different outcomes to create the mechanisms needed f"}

The challenge for all societies is to monitor and mitigate these risks, while not losing sight of the sustained investments in institutional reform and addressing the underlying risks, especially those associated with inequalities and exclusion. These underlying risks are taken up in more detail in chapter 4. Addressing underlying risks and enhancing the capacity to mitigate shocks entail tackling institutional reform. Risk and opportunity tend to accumulate in critical spaces, which this study calls arenas of contestation, where access to power, resources, services, and security are deter- mined. Institutional reform is the entry point for addressing risk in the arenas; this issue is discussed in detail in chapter 5. As chapter 6 explains, all countries that sig- niﬁ cantly reduced violent conﬂ ict eventu- ally undertook institutional reform to manage risk. Drawing on the framework presented here, ﬁ ve key implications are evident: First, prevention entails promoting favorable structural conditions, where pos- sible, by fostering a social and political envi- ronment where the deeper drivers of conﬂ ict can be addressed (Giessmann, Galvanek, and Seifert 2017). As chapter 4 argues, many of today’s conﬂ icts are rooted in perceptions of exclusion related to inequalities across groups. Addressing these and t"}

As chapter 4 argues, many of today’s conﬂ icts are rooted in perceptions of exclusion related to inequalities across groups. Addressing these and the narratives that often form around them is critical. The 2030 Agenda provides a framework for addressing some of these issues. Second, prevention means shaping incentives for peace. This can happen both through institutions, as they change their rules and policies, and through key deci- sions by inﬂ uential actors. As noted earlier, broad institutional changes often take years, if not decades. That said, sometimes measures that signal bigger changes can send powerful messages to the population and inﬂ uence the behavior of actors quickly, even if the reforms take much lon- ger to take full effect. Domestic institu- tions play a central role here, both in mitigating conﬂ ict and in sanctioning vio- lent behavior. For example, governments have sent strong messages of change by announcing power-sharing arrangements or nominating a member of an opposition party to the governing administration, adopting reforms that equalize spending across geographic regions, or launching new grievance-redress mechanisms (World Bank 2011). Chapter 5 develops this argu- ment in more detail. Third, actions that inﬂ uence short-term decisions by actors are a very important part of a prevention strategy."}

Third, actions that inﬂ uence short-term decisions by actors are a very important part of a prevention strategy. Decisions by actors alter incentive structures. Mediation efforts can immediately inﬂ uence the calcu- lus of armed actors, encouraging them to commit to a cease-ﬁ re or peace settlement, for example. These are especially important in conveying a change in direction in situa- tions where violence has already escalated and addressing the short-term incentives for violence during a crisis. Promoting peaceful narratives can also play a big role in creating incentives for peace, as chapter 4 explains. Chapter 6 explores how domestic actors have mobilized incentives for peacebuilding. Fourth, shaping incentives for peace also requires a strong focus on arenas where access to power, resources, and security are contested. These arenas deﬁ ne who has access to political power and representa- tion, natural resources (in particular, land and extractives), security and justice, and basic services. Because existing power dynamics determine access to these arenas, prevention means making the arenas more inclusive, particularly to groups that have traditionally been left out of decision- making processes, especially women and youth.

However, as chapter 5 notes, reform in the arenas is often fraught with setbacks and backlashes, as groups who hold power do not often relinquish it easily. Fifth, systemic prevention is very important. In today’s globalized world, systemic trends like climate change, demographic shifts, advancements in ICT, and the rise of transnational criminal networks present risks and opportunities that must be managed carefully.

Scenarios for Pathways to Peace or Violence Effective prevention has a strong tempo- ral dimension. Not everything can—or should—be done at once. Rather, the scale and nature of prevention changes along a society’s pathway. Prevention requires ﬂ exi- bility, adaptability, and a good sense of the right timing and sequencing. Prevention also relies on systematic monitoring of risks and their potential interactions, in order to address underlying and emerging risks and preempt and manage shocks. Every decision point along the pathway presents trade-offs that must be managed carefully. For example, stability and a cease- ﬁ re today can open the space for movement toward a sustainable peace in the future. Likewise, short-term crisis prevention to avert violence may postpone, or even undermine, efforts to make the structural changes for sustained peace. Long-term efforts to develop institutions and mecha- nisms that will systematically address previ- ously identiﬁ ed social, economic, and political factors contributing to conﬂ ict and create resilience toward outbreaks of collec- tive violence should be done in parallel with identifying and providing timely response to emerging risks.

Ideally, prevention efforts represent a continuum of mutually rein- forcing actions, from early monitoring and action on risks, to consistent strengthening of social resilience to invest in peace for future generations. In environments of emerging risks , the greatest number of options are still on the table, and medium- to long-term policies can have an important impact. For domes- tic actors, dealing with underlying and emerging risks entails development plan- ning that will address structural imbal- ances contributing to social polarization and establishing inclusive systems of risk assessment and response. The 2030 Agenda provides multiple entry points to address several risks. T o ensure sustain- ability of these efforts, the reform of exist- ing legislation and institutions and, potentially, the creation of new ones are needed to bolster resilience against risk of violence. Institutional safeguards can enable the monitoring of grievances and their potential for mobilization as well as efforts to address violence and norms that tolerate it, especially against at-risk groups, such as women, children, and minorities.

Among the international actors, devel- opment actors have the widest space to maneuver in environments with emerging risks because the security situation has not deteriorated to the extent that it limits their activities. T o address underlying and emerging risk, indicators of conﬂ ict risk can be embedded within broader moni- toring of macroeconomic trends, paying special attention to countries with struc- tural factors associated with risk of vio- lence, such as high dependence on aid or natural resources. In these moments, conﬂ ict-sensitive development policies will have the most impact in mitigating the risk of violence. International political and security actors have a smaller presence in these environments. In high-risk contexts , risks have intensi- ﬁ ed or compounded to the point that they are picked up by early warning systems. For domestic actors, the incentives for violence are tangible, and the opportunity costs for engaging in violence are decreasing. Meanwhile, the incentives to reverse course are less evident, contributing to an overall environment of uncertainty.

In these situations, development actors often halt or cease operations in high-risk areas; yet, main- taining development projects is critical for buffering populations against the risk of violence. In these moments, it is critical for development actors to identify ways to work through local partners and to employ more ﬂ exible delivery systems, in order to ensure a minimum of basic ser- vice delivery. Finally, in contexts where violence is halted, preventing recurrence is paramount. This is the time where the window of opportunity reopens, providing some space for structural factors to be addressed and institutions to be rebuilt. However, the forces of path dependence remain strong. During this time, it is essential to restore trust and conﬁ dence by rebuilding the core functions of the state. Often, reforms are needed in arenas of contestation where con- ﬂ ict has played out (for example, land or security sector reform).

Taking on illicit economies that can fuel the resur- gence of conﬂ ict is also essential, though more likely to be effective through global coalitions. Preventing recurrence in conflict- affected environments requires sustained attention and resources from interna- tional actors, because conflict has, in most cases, overwhelmed the capacity and legitimacy of many domestic actors to take the actions needed to address conflict drivers. Preventing recurrence is where special financing facilities can have an important impact. Conclusion Investing in prevention of violent conﬂ ict requires a long-term view of how violent conﬂ ict emerges and evolves in societies in order to identify and act on appropriate entry points. The organizing framework presented here helps to deﬁ ne how societies shape unique pathways toward different outcomes as they manage the forces push- ing for peace or violence. The pathway is formed by the decisions of actors, who respond to the structural factors and incen- tives present in society. Within this framework, prevention is a process of building systems where actors are more likely to choose peaceful pathways, by taking advantage of favorable structural factors or mitigating the impacts of unfa- vorable ones, building incentiv"}

The longer and more intentionally a society has built a path toward peace, the higher the probability that it will stay on that path. The scope and nature of possible actions changes along the pathway, in response to the risks and opportunities that are present at different moments. Drawing on this understanding of vio- lence, prevention of violence, and risk, the study turns next to a deeper discussion of some of the factors and processes that often push actors toward violence. In particular, understanding the relationships among groups in a society and their perceptions of whether they are treated fairly is key to understanding the risk of violence.

{"page": 145, "text": "Why People Fight: Inequality, Exclusion, and a Sense of Injustice 109 CHAPTER 4 Why People Fight: Inequality, Exclusion, and a Sense of Injustice Many of today’s violent conﬂ icts relate to group-based grievances arising from inequality, exclusion, and feelings of injus- tice. Every country has groups who believe they suffer one or all of these ills in some measure. Most of the time, the attendant tensions and conﬂ icts may simmer for long periods without boiling over into violence. It is when an aggrieved group assigns blame to others or to the state for its perceived economic, political, or social exclusion that its grievances may become politicized and risk tipping into violence. On their own, inequality among groups and group-based exclusion do not generate violence. But they can create fertile ground upon which grievances can build. In the absence of incentives to avoid violence or address grievances, group leaders may mobilize their cohort to violence. Emotions, collective memories, frustration over unmet expectations, and a narrative that rouses a group to violence can all play a role in this mobilization. The chances of violence are higher if leaders in a group can both frame the inter- group inequality as unfair and assign blame to another actor, usually a different identity group or the state.

In Indonesia, conﬂ ict escalated in one of three resource-rich provinces where elites engaged in “hard ideological work […] to transform unfocused resentments about natural resources into grievances that would mandate violence” (Aspinall 2007, 968). Prevention efforts need to pay special atten- tion to perceptions of inequality and injus- tice (Nygård et al. 2017). The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides a framework through which various social and economic inequalities can be addressed, not only through Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10, which is focused on inequal- ities, but also through other SDGs. This chapter is organized around a com- prehensive review of the multiple strands of research into the relationship between inequality and exclusion and the risk of vio- lent conﬂ ict. It looks at how social groups coalesce—around identity, status, feelings of humiliation, and the perception they are being politically shortchanged, among others—and the conditions under which their grievances can be mobilized.

Inequality and Violent Conﬂ ict The link between inequality and violent conﬂ ict is one of the oldest issues in politi- cal economy. “At least since Aristotle, theo- rists have believed that political discontent and its consequences—protest, instability,"}
{"page": 146, "text": "110 Pathways for Peace violence, revolution—depend not only on the absolute level of economic well-being, but also on the distribution of wealth” (Østby 2013, 4). Two dimensions of inequality are relevant here: inequality among individuals or households (vertical inequality) and inequality among groups (horizontal inequality) (Stewart 2002a). The evidence that horizontal inequality is linked to a higher risk of violent conﬂ ict is stronger than that for vertical inequality (Østby 2013). Nevertheless, although the relationship between inequality and conﬂ ict is not clear or direct, there is reason to believe that reducing inequality may help ease conﬂ ict between groups and thereby lower the risk of violence. Vertical Inequality As noted above, scholars have long argued that economic inequality is fundamentally linked to violent conﬂ ict (Muller 1985). Lichbach (1989, 432) ﬁ nds that “it often appears that the principal political contest and debate in a nation involves a polariza- tion of social groups around distributional issues. ” This view is reﬂ ected in conﬂ ict the- ory, which argues that conﬂ ict arises between the “haves” who wish to maintain the sta- tus quo distribution of resources and the “have-nots” who seek to challenge the exist- ing system and its resource distribution.

For decades, the notion that prosperous societies will be peaceful societies has underpinned development programming and spending. Indeed, the gap between “haves” and “have-nots” remains at the center of much heated contemporary political and aca- demic discussion on the growing income and wealth inequality in some developing and developed countries (Lichbach 1989; Piketty 2013; Justino 2017). The gap has widened to the point where the top 9 per- cent of the world’s population earns half of all global income, while the bottom half controls only about 7 percent of global income (Milanovic 2016). Some income and wealth inequality is inevitable because people start out with dif- ferent natural endowments of physical, social, and human capital and abilities. However, these differences do not explain the differences in individuals’ access to power and opportunity or social exclusion (Stiglitz 2013; Krishnan et al. 2016). Rising income and wealth inequality seems to be due largely to these factors of unequal access and oppor- tunity (Stewart 2002b). Persistent inequality driven by these factors could impede eco- nomic growth; it also may sometimes lead to social and political instability and violent conﬂ ict (Justino and Moore 2015).

Numerous studies have looked at the relationship between vertical inequality, such as individuals’ relative wealth or pov- erty, and conﬂ ict, with mixed ﬁ ndings (Lichbach 1989; Cramer 2003; Østby 2013; Nygård et al. 2017). As Cramer (2003) notes, links between vertical inequality and violent conﬂ ict are elusive. Various studies ﬁ nd that higher inequality increases the likelihood of conﬂ ict, decreases it, or has no impact at all (Russett 1964; Sigelman and Simpson 1977; Lichbach 1989; Bartusevičius 2014). Some studies have found a positive relationship between inequality in income (or land tenure) and conﬂ ict (Nagel 1976). Others argue for a positive relationship between income inequality and the likeli- hood of popular rebellion (Bartusevi čius 2014) or the risk of violence, particularly under semi-repressive regimes (Schock 1996). In some studies, particular forms of inequality are found to matter—for exam- ple, household asset inequality that increased the propensity of civil strife in Uganda (Deininger 2003)—and vertical inequality is found to have a different impact on different conﬂ ict and violence types (Besançon 2005; Nepal, Bohara, and Gawande 2011).

It should be noted, however, that cross-country studies that examine the effect of vertical inequality on the onset of violent conﬂ ict are constrained by major data limitations, both in the availability and reliability of vertical inequality data and in the way conﬂ ict onset is measured. 1 In addi- tion, little empirical testing has been under- taken of the causal mechanisms that have been put forward by the theoretical and"}

Horizontal Inequality Horizontal inequalities are differences in access and opportunities across culturally deﬁ ned (or constructed) groups based on identities such as ethnicity, region, and reli- gion. They create fertile ground for griev- ances, especially when they accumulate across multiple realms, such as economic and political, and social (Østby 2008a; Justino 2017). 2 The hypothesis that horizontal inequal- ity makes countries more vulnerable to conﬂ ict derives from the idea that political, economic, and social inequalities are likely to create grievances among a relatively dis- advantaged group whose members can mobilize along ethnic (or other identity- based) lines to cause violent conﬂ ict. Much research has been done on measurement and quantitative evidence related to this hypothesis. Horizontal inequality as an explanatory factor for violent conﬂ ict rests on three points (Nygård et al. 2017). First, there is a positive relationship between horizontal inequality and the onset of violent conﬂ ict. Second, this positive relationship is due to the presence of group identity and of a sub- jective, collective sense of inequality that creates group grievances.

Third, group grievances can lead to violent conﬂ ict when the group has the opportunity to collec- tively mobilize around its feeling of injus- tice (Gurr 1993; Østby 2013). For hor izontal inequality to spur collec- tive action—which may or may not involve violence—objective inequality must be trans- lated into an “inter-subjectively perceived grievance” (Nygård et al. 2017, 12); that is, the grievance is experienced collectively by the group. Gurr’s (1970) pioneering the- ory of relative deprivation builds a concep- tual model to provide an understanding of the conditions under which individuals resort to violence. He argues that relative deprivation will lead to frustration and aggression that will motivate individuals to rebel. As this chapter discusses, this reason- ing could arguably apply as well to social groups, with relative deprivation deﬁ ned as actors’ perceptions of discrepancy between what they think they are rightfully entitled to achieve and what they are actually capable of achieving. 3 Additionally, while most of the focus in this line of research to date has been on the impact of objective inequality among groups, some recent stud- ies have tried to address perceived griev- ances as well. 4 Economic Inequality among Gro"}

Ethnicity is broadly deﬁ ned along ethnoreligious and ethnolin- guistic groups (Østby, Nordås, and Rød 2009; Cederman, Gleditsch, and Buhaug 2013). Issues related to measuring and deﬁ ning ethnicity, including questions related to endogeneity, are discussed throughout this chapter. Scholars have tried to understand the relationship quantitatively by building summary indices of economic horizontal inequality and by measures of relative posi- tion. Cross-country studies that construct summary indices of economic horizontal inequality generally ﬁ nd a positive and sta- tistically signiﬁ cant relationship between horizontal inequality and conﬂ ict (Østby 2008a, 2008b). These studies mostly use data from a range of countries, such as data from the Demographic and Health Survey, to measure the difference in asset owner- ship between each country’s two largest eth- nic groups and to study its relationship with violent conﬂ ict (Østby 2008a, 2008b).

Celiku and Kraay (2017) ﬁ nd that this measure of hori- zontal economic inequality is a good predic- tor of the outbreak of conﬂ ict. Other cross-country studies focus on measures of the relative position an identity group holds within the wealth distribution in a geographic area (Cederman, Weidmann, and Gleditsch 2011; Cederman, Gleditsch, and Buhaug 2013). These studies allow the likelihood that each group will take part in conﬂ ict in a given area to be examined. One important advantage these studies have in comparison with the summary indices men- tioned above is that they create the opportu- nity to disentangle the effect of relative deprivation from the effect of relative privi- lege. This is an important distinction that relies on different theoretical underpinnings for why certain groups would want to incite violent conﬂ ict. These studies ﬁ nd robust evi- dence of a positive relationship between relatively disadvantaged groups and vio- lent conﬂ ict (Cederman, Weidmann, and Gleditsch 2011; Cederman, Gleditsch, and Buhaug 2013; Cederman, Weidmann, and Bormann 2015).

Deprivation is measured as the distance between the deprived group’s estimated gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and the average GDP per capita of all groups. However, there is evidence that some- times relatively privileged groups are the ones that initiate violence, a ﬁ nding discussed at greater length later in this chapter. Political Inequality among Groups Recent quantitative studies and qualitative analysis support a strong and positive link between political exclusion of certain groups and violent conﬂ ict, making politi- cal inclusion a particularly signiﬁ cant goal for prevention of violence (Jones, Elgin- Cossart, and Esberg 2012; Cederman, Gleditsch, and Buhaug 2013). This is a key message of this study and is discussed in greater detail in chapters 5 and 6. Political horizontal inequality can be broadly deﬁ ned to include inequalities in the distribution and access to political opportunity and power among groups, including access to the executive branch and the police and military. It also relates to the ability of indi- viduals to participate in political processes.

Early empirical investigations used data from the Minorities at Risk project, which considers indices of political discrimination among ethnic groups and political differen- tials measured by political status between groups. Results using the Minorities at Risk data set were mixed, in part because of the quality of the data (Gurr 1993). More recent quantitative studies have used the Ethnic Power Relations data set, which includes measures of the exclusion of ethnic groups from executive power (Buhaug, Cederman, and Gleditsch 2014; Vogt et al. 2015). 5 Several of these studies ﬁ nd that group-level exclusion from the executive branch increases the risk that these groups will participate in conﬂ ict; an ethnic group’s recent loss of power also increases that risk (Cederman, Wimmer, and Min 2010; Cederman, Weidmann, and Gleditsch 2011; Cederman, Gleditsch, and Buhaug 2013; Cederman, Weidmann, and Bormann 2015).

They attribute this to the discrepancy between a group’s demo- graphic power and its political privileges.

Education is particularly rel- evant, given that it is strongly connected to future economic activity and well-being and plays an important role in national identity and social cohesion. Although quantitative evidence on the social dimen- sion of horizontal inequality is rather limited, 6 studies have sought to examine the association between social inequality and conﬂ ict (Omoeva and Buckner 2015). Omoeva and Buckner (2015), for exam- ple, build a cross-country panel data set of educational attainment and ﬁ nd a robust relationship between higher levels of hori- zontal inequality in education among eth- nic and religious groups and the likelihood of violent conﬂ ict. They ﬁ nd that a one standard deviation increase in horizontal inequality in educational attainment more than doubles the odds that a country will experience a conﬂ ict in the next ﬁ ve years; this relationship was statistically signiﬁ cant in the 2000s and was robust to multiple speciﬁ cations while not being present in earlier decades (Omoeva and Buckner 2015).

The authors hypothesize that in the 1970s and 1980s, high levels of education inequality were not perceived as a sufﬁ cient reason for grievances to build. It could also be that large differences between ethnic or religious groups in educational attainment signal higher levels of exclusion of speciﬁ c groups (Omoeva and Buckner 2015). Social differences between ethnic groups can sometimes represent group discrimination. Education policies have been used to dis- criminate against minorities or other ethnic groups, as has been shown in postapartheid South Africa and Sri Lanka, for example (Gurr 2000; Stewart 2002b). Using Demographic and Health Survey data on a set of developing countries, Østby (2008b) ﬁ nds that for a country with low levels of horizontal social inequality (5th percentile), the probability of onset of civil conﬂ ict in any given year is 1.75 percent. This probability increases to 3.7 percent when the level of horizontal social inequal- ity rises to the 95th percentile.

Speciﬁ cally, they ﬁ nd that higher life expectancy and educational attainment, the latter measured by average years of schooling, were associated with a lower risk of civil war. However, reverse causality can be a potential problem because conﬂ ict can sometimes increase horizontal social inequality. Box 4.1 elaborates on the issue of reverse causality. A district-level study of Indonesia ﬁ nds that horizontal inequality in child mortality rates was positively associated with ethnic- based communal violence (Mancini, Stewart, and Brown 2008). Other measures of horizontal inequality include civil service employment, unemployment, education, and poverty among farmers. The study ﬁ nds these factors were also linked to the incidence of conﬂ ict, but that the effects were much less pronounced. In another analysis, Østby et al. (2011) ﬁ nd that in Indonesian districts with high population growth, horizontal inequality in infant mortality rates is related to violence.

Relatively privileged groups may initiate violence to preserve their power and their access to important resources (Stewart 2002a). A privileged group that produces wealth may develop a sense of injustice if it sees a redistribution of that wealth as an unfair beneﬁ t to another region or group. Asal et al. (2016) ﬁ nd that ethnic groups that face political exclusion and live in an area that produces oil wealth are more likely to experience violent conﬂ ict than groups that experience only exclusion.

There is also evidence that in the case of separatist move- ments, relatively privileged groups some- times initiate violence (Brown 2010). Whether relatively wealthier groups are more likely to participate in conﬂ icts is debatable. Several authors ﬁ nd that this is the case by conducting studies comparing a group’s GDP per capita to the GDP per cap- ita of all groups (Cederman, Weidmann, and Gleditsch 2011; Cederman, Weidmann, and Bormann 2015), but other studies fail to ﬁ nd a signiﬁ cant relationship (Buhaug, Cederman, and Gleditsch 2014; Fjelde and Østby 2014). In their theoretical model of conﬂ ict and economic change, Mitra and Ray (2014) show that increasing a speciﬁ c group’s income lowers the chances of that group’s participating in violence. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that they also ﬁ nd that raising one group’s income may increase the chance that that same group will be the target of violence because other privileged groups would perceive that increase as los- ing their own comparative advantage. As explored in more detail below, steep changes in the relative status of groups can foment new grievances that increase the risk of violence, even if the change reduces inequalities.

BOX 4.1 The Challenge of Causality for Policy Action Studies of the relationship between inequality and violent conﬂ ict are subject to the issue of endogeneity, and speciﬁ cally reverse causality, with implications for prevention policy. Greater inequality may increase the likelihood of violent conﬂ ict, and violent conﬂ ict may worsen inequality. Collier et al. (2003) call this “development in reverse,” where violent conﬂ ict may deepen the problems that led groups to take up arms in the ﬁ rst place. However, overall case study evidence is mixed on whether conﬂ ict indeed widens or reduces horizontal inequality. In fact, Bircan, Bruck, and Vothknecht (2017) ﬁ nd that conﬂ ict increases vertical inequality, but the impact is not permanent. Fearon (2010) includes variables that measure the extent of the population that is excluded or discriminated against in regression analysis and argues that including such variables effectively results in the running of a “policy regression.” This means that a variable that is a direct policy choice is used as an independent variable in regression analysis, thus allowing the researcher to explore the effect of speciﬁ c policy choices.

Endogeneity can lead to over- or underestimating the causal impact in a speciﬁ c country with more exclusionary policies. Wucherpfennig, Hunziker, and Cederman (2016) argue that empirical analysis that does not correct for endogeneity will overestimate the effect of political exclusion on the risk of violent conﬂ ict. They suggest that governments then may strategically exclude conﬂ ict- prone ethnic groups or regions. If conﬂ ict-prone groups are included in a government, empirical analysis that does not correct for endogeneity will artiﬁ cially underestimate this effect. A few studies have used an instrumental variables approach to correct for endogeneity, but this remains an area for further exploration and research. Improving the link between different types of horizontal inequality and higher risk of violent conﬂ ict would contribute to better informing prevention policies.

A deep-rooted sense of exclusion and a perception of injustice seem to be present in many violent conﬂ icts. These factors are key in grievance formation. Changes in sta- tus and political exclusion are especially potent. The perception of exclusion is also persuasive, even when it is at odds with a group’s objective situation in relation to other groups’ . Although exclusion and inequality based on gender and age are not linked to conﬂ ict risk in a direct way, the participation and inclusion of women and young people strengthen a country’s capac- ity to manage and avert conﬂ ict (Paffenholz et al. 2017). The Importance of Political Exclusion in Conﬂ ict Risks Some qualitative case studies and quantita- tive evidence suggest that political exclusion is very important in fostering between-group tensions that can lead to violence. Political exclusion provides leaders of deprived groups with an incentive to act to change the situation. Some have argued that political exclusion is more visible—and therefore groups can more easily assign blame, one of the steps considered essential in stirring grievances to violence—than economic dis- advantage (Jones, Elgin-Cossart,"}

Data limitations regarding political exclusion, however, are even more severe than they are for economic exclusion. Some recent work tries to address the lim- itations. The latest Ethnic Power Relations data set compiles data for the period 1946–2013 that includes all “politically relevant ethnic groups” 7 in 141 countries and their access to power in the executive branch, including cabinet positions and control of the army (Cederman, Wimmer, and Min 2010). 8 The indicator for SDG target 16.7, which is being developed, will provide additional possibilities for mea- suring political inclusion. Cederman, Gleditsch, and Buhaug (2013) show that politically excluded groups experience conﬂ ict at a much higher frequency in comparison with included groups. They also show that the less included a group is politically, the more likely it is to ﬁ ght the incumbent gov- ernment.

But size has a strong positive effect toward violence for excluded groups. This ﬁ nding is interpreted as evi- dence that conﬂ ict is to a large extent driven by grievances, since one would expect the perceived injustice to increase with the size of the excluded population, rather than group size being regarded as simply a proxy for resource endowment (Cederman, Gleditsch, and Buhaug 2013). Other evidence suggests that excluded groups will be more likely to engage in col- lective violent action when they perceive the political system to be completely closed to their group, as opposed to when they believe they have minimum representation (Jost and Banaji 2004). A group may well suffer exclusion in sev- eral dimensions at once, and the overlap of different types of exclusion can heighten the risk of violent conﬂ ict. Cederman, Gleditsch, and Buhaug (2013) ﬁ nd that groups excluded both economically and politically will be more likely to participate in violent conﬂ ict than groups excluded in only one dimension. They conclude that the effect of economic horizontal inequality on violent conﬂ ict is conditional on political exclusion.

There are causal con- nections between educational access and income: lack of access to education, lack of education, or both, lead to fewer economic opportunities, which is correlated with low income. At the same time, the low income of certain groups leads to lower educational attainment, which creates a vicious cycle for relatively deprived groups. Exclusion in rec- ognition of culture, especially related to lan- guage use, can also affect educational and economic opportunities and outcomes as a result. It also reinforces group identities. Stewart (2009) suggests that conﬂ ict is less likely when a particular group that is relatively deprived in one dimension is priv- ileged in another. In cases in which a group is economically or socially excluded (or both), but the group’s elite holds power or participates in the government, the elite are less likely to organize or lead a rebellion. She cites the examples of Malaysia and Nigeria, suggesting that after their civil wars the group that was economically disadvantaged held a numerical majority and was also politically advantaged. Having political power reduces the elites’ motives to rebel and gives them an opportunity to correct the inequalities faced by their group.

Inclusion of Women and Gender Equality The degree to which women are included in political, economic, and social life is a key factor inﬂ uencing a society’s propensity for conﬂ ict. Gender inequality is often a reﬂ ec- tion of overall levels of exclusion in a soci- ety and its tendency to resort to violence as a means of resolving conﬂ ict (GIWPS and PRIO 2017; T essler and Warriner 1997; Caprioli and Tumbore 2003; Caprioli 2005; Melander 2005; Caprioli et al. 2007; Hudson et al. 2009; O’Reilly 2015; UNSC 2015a; Crespo-Sancho 2017; Kelly 2017; Nygård et al. 2017). Several large-sample, quantitative studies have explored the relationship between gen- der exclusion and violent conﬂ ict, ﬁ nding that women’s status relative to men’s, espe- cially their vulnerability to violence, is a sig- niﬁ cant predictor of the country’s propensity for violent conﬂ ict overall (Caprioli 2000; Caprioli and Boyer 2001; Caprioli and Tumbore 2003; Regan and Paskeviciute 2003; Hudson et al. 2012).

They ﬁ nd that the higher the level of violence against women, the more likely a country may be not to comply with international norms and treaty agreements, and the less peacefully it will operate in the international system. Changes in women’s experiences can be viewed as early warning signs of social and political insecurity. These signs may include an increase in domestic violence, increased risk of gender-based violence outside the home, an increase in the number of female- headed households, a decrease in girls’ attending school because of security con- cerns, and an increase in pregnancy termi- nations (Hudson et al. 2012).

Some of these experiences are discussed further in chapter 6. However, gender equality by itself is not a panacea or absolute bulwark against the risk of violent conﬂ ict. Even countries where women enjoy relatively solid access to the political, social, and economic spheres may be affected by violent conﬂ ict. Indeed, in one of the trends in contempo- rary violent conﬂ ict discussed in chapter 1, conﬂ ict has spread to middle-income countries with relatively developed institu- tions. Among these countries is the Syrian Arab Republic, where women, or at least urban women, had relatively wide educa- tional and professional opportunities (UNICEF 2011). Gender exclusion is maintained by social norms that prescribe certain roles for women and men. These norms affect not only the propensity for conﬂ ict, but the experience of conﬂ ict by women and men, as discussed in chapter 1.

In many cases, however, the potential to take advan- tage of these roles is limited, especially in the postconﬂ ict period. In a study of six conﬂ ict and postconﬂ ict countries, Justino et al. (2012) ﬁ nd that although women increased their participation in new labor markets during conﬂ ict, and in some cases overall household welfare improved in eco- nomic terms, they earned less than male colleagues and often lost their jobs in the postconﬂ ict period. In addition, the increased participation in new jobs was not accompanied by any reduction in their household labor; on the contrary, these responsibilities tended to increase as women took over as heads of household while male partners and family members were recruited or abducted into armed groups. Once conﬂ ict ended, they faced pressure to return to more traditional roles, and were often tasked with caring for male relatives injured during conﬂ ict or orphaned children.

Empirical studies have documented the positive role women can play: • Paffenholz (2015) establishes that meaningful participation of women in peace negotiations results in participants being more satisﬁ ed with the outcomes, and thus, agreements that tend to be longer lasting. • Women’s inclusion in peace processes has a positive impact on the durability of peace agreements (O’Reilly, Ó Súilleabháin, and Paffenholz 2015). • Stone (2015) shows that the inclusion of women as negotiators, mediators, signatories, and witnesses increases the probability of an agreement’s lasting at least two years by 20 percent, and the probability of an agreement’s lasting at least 15 years by 35 percent. • Increasing the number of women at the negotiating table, although necessary and helpful, is not enough; rather, increasing the number of women with quality participation should be the target (Anderlini 2007; Paffenholz 2015)."}
{"page": 154, "text": "118 Pathways for Peace Gender norms affect the experience of conﬂ ict for men as well. The perpetrators of violence are predominantly men, as are most members of violent extremist groups, gangs, militias, and armies. Even so, the vast major- ity of men do not perpetrate violence, young men are not inherently violent, men actively participate in peace building, and men are the primary direct victims of violent conﬂ ict (with more men dying on the battleﬁ eld) (Spiegel and Salama 2000; Reza, Mercy, and Krug 2001; Obermeyer, Murray, and Gakidou 2008). All this suggests that mascu- linity is in large part a social construct, and that men create violent identities because of social, cultural, and political expectations and pressures placed upon them (Bannon and Correia 2006; V ess et al. 2013). A corol- lary explored below is that masculinity does not drive violence so much as do environ- ments where men are unable to assert and fulﬁ ll other nonviolent masculine identities. In a study of nine violence-affected countries UNDP (forthcoming) identiﬁ es four common and interrelated roles associ- ated with manhood.

Important differences in men’s abilities to assert these roles appear in a noncrisis set- ting as compared with a crisis setting (see ﬁ gure 4.1). In a crisis setting, men are unable to assert their roles of provider and procreator and to acquire social standing. A demand for traditional, patriarchal mascu- linities that advocates for the use of violence can surge within young men who seek to reassert their threatened masculinity. Although men’s roles are challenged in con- ﬂ ict settings, not all men will develop vio- lent behaviors. Norms do not change quickly or easily. Indeed, although formal, institutional changes, such as legislation protecting women’s rights, can occur relatively quickly, norms require much more time to change, and tend to be more resistant to change (Petesch 2012). When they are in ﬂ ux, those who step outside the older, more rigid norms into new roles—from women who leave their households or communities to study or work in the city, to men who take on more domestic respon- sibilities—face a heightened risk of violence if their communities persist in enforcing more traditional norms (Boudet et al. 2012).

These questions are particularly salient in light of the global trends described in chapter 2, such as the historically high number of young people in the world today, the high levels of youth unemployment, and the growing transnational reach of violent extremist groups that actively recruit youth. While many have hypothesized that a demographic “youth bulge” is a structural risk of conﬂ ict (Collier 2000; Urdal 2006), more recent, cross-country work ﬁ nds that whether a large youth population constitutes a threat or, to the contrary, a “demographic BOX"}

Young people face a wide array of development challenges. They are often victims of multiple and interlocking forms of discrimination that can lead to an imbalance of power that excludes young people from being recognized socially as adults, undermining their needs and aspirations. Intergenerational inequality, and youth perceptions of lower status and fewer opportunities than their parents had at the same age, can also contribute to frustration (Ginges et al. 2007; Atran and Ginges 2012; Höhne 2013; Honwana 2013; Idris 2016; UNDP 2017b). Youth exclusion is often highlighted as a key factor in violent conﬂ ict. Programs around the world have focused on increasing employment opportunities for youth, but they have had mixed results. Evidence shows that employment can, in some cases, contribute to protecting youth against mobilization to violence, but that the motivations for joining armed groups are not limited to economics. They often stem from frustration with the rigidity of intergenerational social structures (Ginges et al. 2007; Atran and Ginges 2012; Höhne 2013; Idr"}

Although it is true that the majority of ﬁ ghters in all types of armed groups are young men, they only ever represent a minority of the youth population in any given country. At the same time, youth groups are important parts of civil society and are forces for effective prevention of violent conﬂ ict. Empowering youth is essential for violence-prevention and peacebuilding efforts. In 2015, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted its Resolution 2250 on Youth, Peace, and Security, recognizing the important and positive contribution of young people in efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. The Security Council called for active engagement of youth because they represent “a unique demographic dividend that can contribute to lasting peace and prosperity” if inclusive policies are put in place.

More micro- level analysis ﬁ nds that economic, social, and political exclusion prevents young peoples’ transition into adulthood in countries at all income levels, and is often cited as a risk fac- tor for joining armed groups (Ginges et al. 2007; Atran and Ginges 2012; Höhne 2013; Honwana 2013; Mercy Corps 2015; Idris 2016). Indeed, studies from various contexts show that youth’s motivations to join armed groups extend beyond more practical needs for employment or income to a broader frus- tration with the rigidity of intergenerational social structures, frustrated aspirations for social and economic mobility, discrimination, and unmet needs for recognition and respect (Ginges et al. 2007; Atran and Ginges 2012; Botha 2013; Höhne 2013; Mercy Corps 2015; Idris 2016, 40; Devarajan and Ianchovichina 2017). These motivations vary somewhat by gender; generally speaking, male youth are more likely to be motivated to join armed groups out of a need for economic or social mobility, whereas young women may join for protection, the chance for greater autonomy than allowed by mainstream society, to avenge the loss of a loved one, or perceptions of injus- tice and frustration (Bloom 2005, 2011; Brown 2014;"}

As noted earlier in this chapter, unequal access to education and the quality of education can become sources of frustration, feelings of injustice, and grievances that can all increase a society’s risk of violent conﬂ ict. Barriers to meaningful and inclusive youth participation in governance are also important risk factors. The disenfranchise- ment of young people from formal political systems leaves them not only frustrated but also mistrustful of political systems and institutions (UNDP 2017a). In countries with more rigid, conservative power struc- tures and social hierarchies, youth tend to express their dissatisfaction by blaming older generations, thus creating an inter- generational drift. In these settings, youth feel disempowered and frustrated and assert that they receive little attention from those in power, including teachers, elders, and politicians (Abbink 2005).

The research suggests that the motivations and experiences of people in violent extremist groups is similar to that for other types of armed groups. Empirical work on youth motivations, and on extremist groups’ recruiting strategies, is scarce—although increasing in some areas—because of sev- eral important limitations (World Bank 2015; UNDP 2017b). These constraints include, ﬁ rst, the difﬁ culties of accessing members of clandestine groups, resulting in a bias toward people who have left such groups or who have been imprisoned for crimes committed while members (Barrett 2011; Atran and Stone 2015; Mercy Corps 2015; Stern and Berger 2015; ISS 2016). A strong bias toward male ﬁ ghters contrib- utes to a limited understanding of women’s involvement (Ladbury 2015) as well as of the various roles that people can play in these groups. Most studies tend to focus on one group in one setting, which has given rise to some rich case studies, but often offers little in the way of generalizability for orienting policy in other contexts or toward other groups (ISS 2016; Mercy Corps 2016; CeSID 2017; EIP 2017).

Grievances against the state were an import- ant motivating factor; frustration with per- ceived corruption or lack of access to political representation was key. One of the most striking ﬁ ndings relates to grievances against security actors: 78 percent of the sample reported low levels of trust in the police or military, and 71 percent said that the killing or arrest of a family member or friend prompted them to join an extremist group (UNDP 2017b).

Motivations when individuals join voluntarily • Perception of injustice at the hands of the state is suggested to be a strong motivation, along with a sense of frustration with the state. These grievances toward the state may revolve around elite corruption and perceptions that the state is illegitimate. Members of social groups who feel marginalized or excluded experience such grievances most acutely. The narrative offered by some violent extremist groups of an egalitarian and moral order, marked by justice and fairness, may appear to be an attractive alternative. • Experience of violence, persecution, and repression from the state, notably by its police and military forces against family members and friends, is a documented tipping point for individuals to voluntarily join violent extremist groups.

Recruiters often appeal to this desire for social membership and social recognition by portraying the group as a fellowship. • Prospects for earning income and economic empowerment are rarely the main reason for joining, but in some cases may motivate poor youth and educated middle-class youth with higher expectations of social mobility. • The need for physical protection is cited as a motivating factor. In a conﬂ ict context that is dangerous and unstable, and notably when the presence of the state is weak, individuals may join an extremist group to protect themselves or their family, broader group, or property. • Women or girls may seek other ways to assert their identity and independence as a result of gender-based inequality, (Box continued next page)"}

Indeed, evi- dence suggests that perceptions of exclusion and inequality often matter more for their potential for mobilization than do mea- sured inequality and exclusion (Gurr 1970). Studies that ﬁ nd a relationship between objective horizontal inequality and violent conﬂ ict assume that the relationship is mediated through perceptions (Østby 2008a; Cederman, Wimmer, and Min 2010; Cederman, Gleditsch, and Buhaug 2013). 11 However, the correlation between objective and perceived horizontal inequality is not as high as might be expected (see box 4.5).

Recent studies have shifted from mea- suring group-level grievances expressed by leaders to measuring individual-level per- ceptions assessed from survey questions. The shift reﬂ ects the view that objective inequality results in violent conﬂ ict only if a sufﬁ cient number of group members view the inequality as unjust and can cast blame on another group or on the state (Cederman, Gleditsch, and Buhaug 2013). Most studies that use these various types of perception measures ﬁ nd a posi- tive correlation between perceptions and behavior or attitudes that would favor vio- lence. For example, respondents’ percep- tion that the government was treating their group unfairly was found to be associated with an increased rate of participation in demonstrations and also higher levels of support for violence.

This approach has been criticized on a number of grounds. One argument is that individuals may view their own living conditions differently than do other members of their group. Another is that this measure does not account for group identiﬁ cation, which is key in comparing the aggrieved group and other groups. An additional criticism is that it is not clear which reference group to use as a comparison—the national average, the largest group in the country, or the largest group in the region. Rustad (2016) argues that the reference group should be the largest group in the region because people most likely compare themselves to groups that are near them geographically. She applies this in a study of perceived horizontal inequalities in the Niger Delta. A second strand of the literature uses questions about perceived horizontal inequality a or groups’ relative political inﬂ uence in surveys, such as Afrobarometer (Miodownik and Nir 2016; Must 2016).

Finally, a third strand of the literature focuses on answers to survey questions about how frequently individual group members feel their group is treated unfairly by the government (Kirwin and Cho 2009; Miodownik and Nir 2016). This approach is more comprehensive because the question, in principle, covers various dimensions of injustice. b However, the pertinent question also forces the respondent to evaluate the situation as fair or unfair and also to assign blame for the situation to the government, while in many cases the situation is more complex than that. The second strand of literature tries to capture perceptions of inequality, whereas this third strand captures the level of collective grievance of certain ethnic groups. Indicators to measure Sustainable Development Goal targets 16.6 and 16.7 are being developed along the third strand (proportion of population, by sex, age, disability, and population group, who believe decision making is inclusive and responsive; and proportion of the population satisﬁ ed with their last experience of public services, respectively). a.

The authors ﬁ nd the following: • Perceptions of group political depriva- tion were associated with a lower risk of participation in demonstrations among African individuals, along with lower support for violence. • Perceptions of group economic depriva- tion had no discernable effect. A study across four states in Nigeria (Rustad 2016) ﬁ nds evidence that individuals who rated their conditions as poor were more likely to express support for vio- lence in their attitudes. However, the ﬁ ndings were different when aggregated to the group level: belonging to a dis- trict or ethnic group where the average score of self-reported conditions was much poorer than that in the richest or largest group was associated with lower support for violence. This ﬁ nding could be evidence that members of relatively privileged groups are more likely to sup- port violence. There is more evidence of a robust rela- tionship between perceptions and violent conﬂ ict when perceptions are couched as unfair government treatment rather than in direct or aggregate measures of perceived material inequality.

However, in the absence of data, it is commonly assumed that perceptions of inequality will likely correspond to objective measures of inequality (Stewart 2002a; Cederman, Gleditsch, and Buhaug 2013). Studies therefore have focused on the relationship of the objective inequality to violent con- flict—with mixed conclusions. Some find support for the argument that there is a correspondence (Gurr 1993; Holmqvist 2012); yet other studies find instead that often perceptions do not correspond to the objective reality (Langer and Smedts 2013). In a survey that includes Nigeria and Ghana, Langer and Ukiwo (2008) find a discrepancy between objective actual conditions and group members’ perceptions of access to political power and education. Rustad’s (2016) study in the Niger Delta also finds little overlap between the objective and perceived income levels of different ethnic groups (see figure 4.2). 13 FIGURE 4.2 Perceived and Objective Horizontal Inequality of Ethnic Groups in Nigeria Source: Rustad 2016. –1.2 –1.0 –0.8 –0.6 –0.4 –0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 Horizontal inequality Ogoni Nigerian Igbo Others Yoruba Ethnic groups Edo Itsekiri Urhobo Ijaw Isoko Perceived horizontal inequality Actual horizontal ine"}

Many social groups may feel excluded or may objectively suffer from exclusion; inequality is present in most, if not all, countries. But only in very few countries will these circumstances lead ﬁ rst to group- based grievances and then to violent conﬂ ict. Despite the relatively little in-depth research around these transformations, this section explores evidence that has emerged on the progression from exclusion to grievance, and then from grievance to violent conﬂ ict. Exclusion based on identity is at the heart of many conﬂ icts. It is generally recog- nized that identity is fungible, neither static nor exclusive (Woolcock 2014). Different identities tend to become salient at different times and in different circumstances, and thus are context speciﬁ c in their importance to mobilization to violent conﬂ ict (see box 4.6). For example, castes became politi- cally salient in India only after the British began conducting national censuses, which required respondents to be placed into ﬁ xed demographic categories that were deter- mined by the British themselves (Dirks 2001; Woolcock 2014).

Similarly, Posner (2007) documents how leaders in Zambia and Kenya emphasized national-level ethnic cleavages to incite violence. BOX 4.6 Identity and Mobilization to Violence: The Demographics and the Dynamics of Difference Many studies on the association of horizontal inequality with violent conﬂ ict use social factors such as ethnicity, religion, and language as group identiﬁ ers. For example, contrary to prevailing belief, recent evidence suggests that conﬂ ict may be more likely within linguistic dyads than within religious ones. Moreover, Bormann, Cederman, and Vogt (2015) ﬁ nd no support for the thesis that Muslim groups are particularly conﬂ ict prone. Social identity, however, is not a static demographic characteristic. Individuals have multiple, overlapping forms and sources of identity that only become politically salient under particular conditions. For example, Kingston, Jamaica, is essentially monoethnic from a demographic perspective, is vibrantly democratic, and does not have unduly high economic inequality. Yet it is one of the most violent cities in the world. Why? Because political leaders are able to mobilize politically salient (but statistically unobservable) f"}

Because political leaders are able to mobilize politically salient (but statistically unobservable) forms of social identity to protect their space and expand their markets (Duncan-Waite and Woolcock 2008). Rather than looking at demographics of difference, some social scientists are increasingly studying what might be called the dynamics of difference— the conditions under which particular aspects of people’s identities can be mobilized for large-scale collective action, whether for constructive or harmful purposes (Weber 1976; Mamdani 1996; Marx 1998; Baiocchi 2010). Needless to say, this juxtaposition—between the demographics and the dynamics of difference—is perhaps overly simpliﬁ ed (indeed, students of ethnicity seem to revel in creating ever-ﬁ ner distinctions when locating themselves in the theoretical landscape), but for present purposes it is a fruitful one for elucidating the key differences between most economists and many other social scientists studying ethnicity and violence. For example, careful micro-level studies of the conditions under which ethnicity can or cannot be mobilized for the purposes of violence (Varshney 2002; Posner 2004) suggest, as McGovern (2011, 350) notes, “that participants in violent politics are operating according to rational and irrational"}

{"page": 162, "text": "126 Pathways for Peace The existence of diverse identity groups does not, by itself, move people to collective action. Nor does the prevalence of inequali- ties across those groups. There are plenty of examples of diverse societies with distribu- tional differences on various dimensions that do not create frustration and that are accepted by people. The process of grievance formation around inequalities appears to be the link between the existence of those inequalities and whether they generate some kind of col- lective action. Cederman, Gleditsch, and Buhaug (2013) explore this process, arguing that inequalities have to be politicized to become grievances. They identify three nec- essary steps for this politicization of griev- ances: First, there must be well-deﬁ ned and separate identiﬁ able groups in society. 14 Second, a group must be able to compare itself and its status to other groups, either by objective measures or perceptions. Finally, groups must frame the intergroup inequality as unfair and assign blame to another group The wider literature on social move- ments includes some similar discussion of grievance formation. For example, a feeling of injustice and assignment of blame have been identiﬁ ed as necessary to the transfor- mation of inequality and exclusion into grievance (Tarrow 2011).

However, group perceptions may differ in different contexts, and what one group perceives as just at one time may be perceived as unjust by the same group at a different time. 15 The severity of polarization among groups in a society also inﬂ uences how or whether inequalities and perceived exclu- sion translate into grievances, and then into violent conﬂ ict. Scholars generally agree that ethnic polarization is a strong predictor of violent conﬂ ict (Montalvo and Reynal- Querol 2012; Bader and Ianchovichina 2017). Some studies suggest a strong rela- tionship between polarization and the risk of genocide (Montalvo and Reynal-Querol 2008). Horowitz (2000) argues that more homogeneous societies tend to be less vio- lent than highly heterogeneous societies, and that more conﬂ icts occur in societies in which a large ethnic minority faces an eth- nic majority. Similarly, Easterly, Ritzen, and Woolcock (2006) ﬁ nd that the polarization of two large groups of similar size—for example, when a large minority is in conﬂ ict with a large minority—presents the highest likelihood of violent conﬂ ict.

Some movements take a nonviolent approach, using tactics such as boycotts, marches, sit-ins, strikes, and silent vigils. Societies in which people feel the system is just and responsive to their grievances are societies most likely to be able to peacefully express grievances. In turn, social move- ments that do not use violence tend to be more successful. Chenoweth and Stephan (2011) ﬁ nd that nonviolent movements with political aims are twice as successful, on aver- age, in achieving their objectives than those that use violence, and pave the way to more durable and internally peaceful societies. What, then, are the factors that inﬂ uence whether collective mobilization involves violence? Justino (2017, 3) argues that “whether social mobilization motivated by inequalities may turn violent is ultimately conditional on how people, individually or in groups, perceive themselves in relation to others in society” (see ﬁ gure 4.3).

Mobilization tends to be informal or less organized and reﬂ ects some sort of agreement among less privileged groups at the bottom of the distribution to resist the power of elites. • Fragmented social mobilization occurs when social agreements are not possible. • Violent social mobilization occurs when different groups engage in violent action to resolve disputes with other groups or with the state."}
{"page": 163, "text": "Why People Fight: Inequality, Exclusion, and a Sense of Injustice 127 Most often, collective mobilization driven by grievances is channeled toward conﬂ ict with the state rather than against another group or groups (Stewart 2002a). This occurs especially if the state is seen as “captured” for the economic beneﬁ t or interest of a speciﬁ c socioeconomic group, or when the state is seen as acting solely to protect its own interests. Cederman, Wimmer, and Min (2010) suggest conﬂ ict with the government is more likely when the following three conditions prevail: 1. A group or its representatives are excluded from executive power, especially after a loss of power. The recent loss of power or prestige of excluded groups produces feelings of anger and resentment and increases the impulse to ﬁ ght to change the situation. Call (2012) ﬁ nds that per- ceived exclusionary behavior after inter- nal armed conﬂ icts correlates highly with conﬂ ict recurrence. Ghatak (2016) ﬁ nds that exclusion of small numbers of people from state power likely results in domestic terrorism; civil war is highly likely when the number of politically excluded groups increases.

Mobilization and violent contes- tation require both motivation and orga- nizational capacity (Gurr 2000). Larger groups not only enjoy more legitimacy but also can draw on their networks for recruitment and resources to sustain their cause (McCarthy and Zald 1977; Cederman, Buhaug, and Rød 2009). For example, Posner (2004) ﬁ nds that the main reason Chewas and Tumbukas are allies in Zambia and adversaries in Malawi stems from the different size of each group relative to each country’s national political arena. In Malawi, he notes, Chewas and Tumbukas are large groups, and thus serve as viable bases for political coalition building. In Zambia, both groups are relatively small com- pared with the country as a whole, thus making it more difﬁ cult and less useful to mobilize for political support. 3. The group has experienced violent con- ﬂ ict in the past. Historical memories of past conﬂ icts inﬂ uence the likelihood of current conﬂ ict.

The way the state relates to different groups in society greatly determines how and whether grievances form against it (box 4.7).

Thoms and Ron (2007) show that violations of physical integrity by state actors are associated with the escalation of existing political conﬂ icts.

The Role of Emotions in Mobilizing Groups People come together in social groups for a kaleidoscope of subjective and objective reasons. They may share feelings, history, narratives of pain, frustrations, or identi- ties that motivate them to collective action in different ways, at different times, and in the face of different situations. A body of scholarly literature argues that these rea- sons may contribute, alone or in combina- tion with inequality and exclusion, to the mobilization of groups to violent action. Understanding how emotions, among other causes, play a role in the production of violent conﬂ ict can also provide policy makers with an understanding of how emotions can also play a role in the cre- ation of more peaceful societies. Emotions are intertwined with griev- ances, both triggering and sustaining col- lective violence (Horowitz 2001; Petersen 2002; Sargsyan 2017).

Fear, for instance, can bond people into a group that mobi- lizes for violence, as when an attack or shock from outside results in a collective response to the perceived threat. Petersen (2002) suggests that fear, rage, hatred, and resentment all play a role in ethnic vio- lence, but that different emotions result in different outcomes. He argues that resent- ment over loss of political power or a decline in status is especially potent, while violent experiences result in fear and anger, and prejudice and stigma bring about con- tempt and hatred. For example, Serbs’ change in status in Kosovo resulted in feel- ings of resentment that fueled repression against Kosovo-Albanians. 17 Collective memory, too, plays into the mobilization of group grievances (Durkheim, Pocock, and Peristiany 1953; Le Goff 1992). As Ross (2007) argues, inter- pretations of events are as important as the events themselves, and in conﬂ ict situations, collective memories can trigger emotional and violent reactions. For example, during the conﬂ ict in Chechnya in the 1990s, Chechen leaders evoked collective memo- ries of past wars and mass deportations, recalling feelings of humiliation to justify a violent struggle for self-determination (Campana 2009).

Collective feelings of humiliation and injustice, as indicated in the Chechen case, can be especially potent motivating factors. Khosrokhavar (2017) suggests that collective mobilization is more likely when feelings of injustice are coupled with resentment. Unmet expectations and thwarted aspi- rations can be a source of frustration that drives mobilization to violence. As dis- cussed in chapter 2 and earlier in this chapter, limited access to employment and livelihood opportunities can affect the rites of passage to adulthood, including marriage and starting families, and leaves many young people feeling frustrated, uncertain, and angry (Kraetsch 2008). Some authors suggest that radicalism can emerge among the highly educated young people that go through these experiences (Al-Azmeh 2006). However, these same frustrations can lead some, including young people, to become activists and peace builders. 18 The Power of Elites and Narratives Elites and leaders play a critical role in mobi- lizing grievances and shaping narratives that may steer groups toward, or away from, vio- lent action.

Failing to act can also be an elite tactic: in some cases, elites decide not to act or not to imple- ment certain beneﬁ cial policies because doing so would challenge the status quo (World Bank 2017b). Elites exert strong inﬂ uence on collective mobilization through the narratives they cre- ate around their group’s experiences. Narratives are stories that represent “the ways in which we construct disparate facts in our own worlds and weave them together cogni- tively in order to make sense of our reality” (Patterson and Monroe 1998, 315). They appeal to emotions, and an especially charis- matic leader can invest the narrative with great power. Elites and other actors can use narra- tives to build social cohesion, as described in chapter 6. A narrative around inclusion, such as around the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, could avert mobilization to violence when there is risk of conﬂ ict. Elites also may use narratives to manipu- late perceptions and memories to mobilize individuals toward collective violence.

Collective experiences of injustice or violence and coercive measures by the state that are perceived as targeting certain groups only reinforce the power of narra- tives and harden group boundaries. Media, both private and government controlled, play a large role today in shaping narratives that can either reduce or inﬂ ame grievances (Sargsyan 2017), a role that is more salient than ever with the rapid growth of informa- tion and communication technology, as discussed in chapter 2. Conclusion Horizontal inequalities and exclusion are important factors in modern violent con- ﬂ ict, although in and of themselves they are not sufﬁ cient to mobilize groups to vio- lence. The available research does not provide evidence of a straightforward path between the two. Nevertheless, this study argues that inequality and exclusion—even merely the perception of exclusion—can evolve into group-based grievances.

Risks are heightened if leaders are able to hook into grievances and assign blame to another group. Oftentimes emo- tions are called upon in narratives that incite violence. V ery often the state is perceived to be the source of grievance, and becomes the target of collective mobilization. An aggrieved group may see the state as acting in its own interest or as controlled by a group that is using the state for its exclusive beneﬁ t. The state also may be incapable of dealing with intergroup grievances or, in the worst-case scenario, may aggravate these tensions through abuses or discriminatory behavior toward speciﬁ c groups. Addressing exclusion and horizontal inequality is therefore important as a prevention strategy.

{"page": 177, "text": "What People Fight Over: Arenas of Contestation 141 CHAPTER 5 What People Fight Over: Arenas of Contestation Maintaining a peaceful pathway entails the constant management of underlying griev- ances and the monitoring of shocks that could trigger violence. Where risks accu- mulate or intensify, they can overwhelm a society’s coping resources, with violence as a frequent result. As chapter 4 argues, cer- tain risks deserve special attention because they underlie most violent conﬂ ict. These risks relate to perceptions of injustice deriving from social, economic, and politi- cal exclusion. This chapter explores the accumulation and intensiﬁ cation of risks and opportuni- ties in critical spaces, called arenas of contes- tation. These arenas involve what groups care about in their relationships with each other and with the state and thus what they tend to ﬁ ght over—access to power, land, and resources, equitable delivery of services, and responsive justice and security. These four broad arenas are by no means an exhaustive list, but they have been selected because they have consistently recurred in violent conﬂ ict in various con- texts. 1 Competition for power, for example, is an age-old source of conﬂ ict, while bal- ances and imbalances of power can put a society in danger of violence.

Experience shows that more inclusive and representa- tive power-sharing arrangements increase the likelihood of peaceful pathways. Land and resources, too, are traditional sources of friction, and this arena is now under more stress with the effects of climate change, population growth, urbanization, and the expansion of large-scale agriculture. The service delivery arena is critical because state legitimacy hinges, in part, on whether the population deems that the processes of service delivery are fair. In this arena, again, inclusiveness and perceptions of fairness matter as much—perhaps more—than the quality of services. Finally, security and jus- tice institutions that operate fairly and in alignment with the rule of law are funda- mental. Conﬂ ict in this arena that is not managed can have long-term impacts on a society’s pathway. The salience of these arenas is demon- strated by the changing proﬁ le of violent conﬂ ict, as described in chapter 1, and by inﬂ uential global trends that may increase risk or open opportunities in these arenas, as discussed in chapter 2. Moreover, contes- tation in these arenas is shaped by the degree of inequality, exclusion, and unfair- ness in a society, as noted in chapter 4, and can increase the risk of violence.

The arenas of power, resources, services, and security are deﬁ ned by the interaction of the unique structural factors, institu- tions, and actors in a society. The state is critical in each of the arenas.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development includes various goals and targets related to these four arenas. For example, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 10.2 addresses political inclu- sion, while target 16.7 addresses responsive, inclusive, participatory, and representative decision making at all levels. With regard to access to services, targets 1.4, 5.4, and 11.1 address basic or public services, targets 3.7 and 3.8 address health, and targets 4.2, 4.3, and 4.5 address education. Targets 5.2, 16.1, and 16.2 address security and violence. In the area of resources, targets 1.4, 2.3, and 12.2 address land, target 6.5 addresses water, SDG 14 addresses oceans, seas, and marine resources, and SDG 15 addresses terrestrial ecosystems. Targeted, ﬂ exible, and sustained atten- tion to these arenas is an important com- ponent of governance in general (World Bank 2017c) and is particularly critical to prevention.

Policy changes alone are insufﬁ - cient; even the most technically sound actions often fall short because they can- not, by themselves, address the underlying incentive structures that drive behavior. Measures are needed to assess and address risk, especially by fostering incentives and norms for peaceful bargaining and negoti- ation within the arenas. This chapter begins by introducing the concept of arenas of contestation as areas for risk and opportunity. Next, it dis- cusses each of the arenas of contestation in more detail, exploring the risks of vio- lence and opportunities for peace that can build up there, the trade-offs that are present when managing them, and the conditions that may amplify risk (for example, attempting major reform during the transition to a more inclusive political system). As substantially broad fields in themselves, it is impossible to treat the arenas in a comprehensive manner here. Instead, key messages and ideas are summarized, with examples drawn from the case studies where appropriate. Chapter 6 contains a more detailed description of the experiences of different societies in managing risks and opportu- nities in the arenas. Risk and Opportunity in the Arenas of Contestation Conﬂ ict that arises in the arenas of contes- tation is especially prone to escalate to vio- lence.

Risk is high chieﬂ y because the stakes are high. As the sites where, ulti- mately, people and groups bargain for access to the basic means of livelihoods and well-being, exclusion from one or more arenas can, often literally, become a matter of life or death. Moreover, the broader balance of power in society is deﬁ ned and defended in these arenas (World Bank 2017c). This balance of power has an impact on the incentives that are so critical for prevention. Actors who are already at the table must agree to change the rules, institutions, or structural factors that deﬁ ne the balance of power in the arenas, and they may see little beneﬁ t in altering the status quo. Leaders who per- ceive reform as an unfair loss of power for themselves or their group, then, have few incentives to propose or support any change in the existing arrangements. Exclusion and inequality often persist, not because leaders lack the technical knowl- edge or capacity for reform, but because they have insufﬁ cient incentives to allow greater access to the arenas. Contestation here is fraught, too, because exclusion and inequality among groups, the precursors of grievance, often manifest most visibly in the arenas.

As the evidence presented in chapter 4 suggests, an identity-based group that perceives itself unfairly deprived relative to other groups—whether because of unequal access to political representation, unequal distribution of basic services, insecure ten- ancy of land, exclusion from justice and security, or some other exclusionary situation—may develop grievances. Both perceived exclusion and objective exclu- sion are important."}
{"page": 179, "text": "What People Fight Over: Arenas of Contestation 143 Finally, the arenas overlap substan- tially, such that any shift in one arena can trigger ripple effects in others. An elec- tion that upsets the political balance of power can trigger a land reform, or judi- cial reforms aiming to address legal dis- crimination against one group may increase their claim on political power. Measures to mitigate a crisis in the short term can affect the conditions needed for lasting reforms. For example, the reloca- tion of a community after a natural disas- ter can complicate efforts for land reform over the long term. Côte d’Ivoire illus- trates how conflict can spill over from one arena and activate conflict in another (box 5.1). At the same time, the overlap of the are- nas means that actions taken in one arena can mitigate risks in another. For example, more inclusive political arrangements have been shown to decrease the risk of violence associated with the “resource curse” around extractives, as discussed in detail in this chapter (Drew 2017). In West Africa, there is evidence that power sharing has had a “mediating effect” on the relationship between natural resources and stability (Vogt 2012).

{"page": 179, "text": "2). The state plays a key role in governing the arenas by embodying constraints and opportunities to inﬂ uence different actors. The state bears ultimate responsibility for setting the rules that govern relationships and access in these important policy are- nas, which it does through laws and the system of formal institutions. Its overall legitimacy in the eyes of citizens is deter- mined by how well it does this. In this way, governance of the arenas is central to the social contract. This does not mean that, in practice, the state must be active and present in all the arenas. As chapters 2 and 3 note, non- state actors generally fill the void where the state is unable or unwilling to provide needed services. In many cases, commu- nity organizations, traditional leadership, the private sector, and civil society are better placed than the state to mediate and address risks as they manifest. In oth- ers, armed groups and organized criminal networks may supplant the state and undermine its legitimacy. Ultimately, however, the state needs to exert a mini- mum presence as a credible facilitator in the arenas if it is to maintain a modicum of legitimacy.

While some localized land conﬂ icts were prevailing in the country, they have been exacerbated by the conﬂ ict in the political arena. Violence came about initially in response to attempts to exclude speciﬁ c groups from central power by denying a northerner the opportunity to participate in presidential elections. These attempts aggravated long-standing resentments related to the political exclusion of northerners. The conﬂ ict quickly revived resentments related to an inﬂ ux of migrants and the contestation of their rights to access, own, and beneﬁ t from land and its related resources. Rents from trade in natural resources, from coffee production to timber and diamonds, provided sources of ﬁ nancing to all sides of the conﬂ ict. A fall in the price of the country’s main export crops, particularly cocoa, exacerbated competition for these resources and further fueled conﬂ ict. Regional disparities in poverty and access to services between the north and south also played an important role. Sources: Marc, Verjee, and Mogaka 2015; McGovern 2011."}

Political power largely determines how economic and other resources are distributed, and there- fore, it is difﬁ cult for actors to increase access to the other policy arenas unless they have some presence (and relative power) in the political realm. Greater inclusion and representation of different groups in the political arena tend to be associated with reduced vio- lence over the longer term. However, as discussed in chapter 2, the transition to a more open and democratic political sys- tem is often fraught with risk of violence because it can disrupt power dynamics and bring forth new groups seeking inﬂ uence. Political Settlements and Mitigation of Risk Political settlements help to manage con- ﬂ icts over political power that risk becom- ing violent, particularly in transitional settings. A political settlement can be an explicit or an implicit bargain among elites over the distribution of rights and entitle- ments. It is often viewed as a prerequisite to avoiding violence in situations of high risk or to reducing the intensity of violent con- ﬂ ict (Lindemann 2008). A peace agr"}

It is often viewed as a prerequisite to avoiding violence in situations of high risk or to reducing the intensity of violent con- ﬂ ict (Lindemann 2008). A peace agreement is a political settlement whose objective is to manage the risks of violence and reach some form of stability. The risk of relapse into conﬂ ict is ele- vated where elites have not sought to accommodate or include former opponents in a political settlement, but have instead moved to exclude rivals on the basis of eth- nicity, religion, or other dimension of iden- tity (Call 2012; Elgin-Cossart, Jones, and Esberg 2012). An agreement among elites is likely to be unsustainable if it is not under- pinned by policy that addresses the griev- ances of the populations that these elites represent or if it includes only elites and excludes the rest of the population. While political settlements are a very important component of any peace process, their ability to contribute to sustained peace is more elusive. Many recent peace processes appear to have produced an uncertain— sometimes transitory—peace that features recurrence of violence, absence of security, and political stalemate (Bell 2017).

Many of today’s peace agreements are characterized as a “formalized political unsettlement, ” where the root causes of the conﬂ ict are carried into the new institutional arrange- ments without being resolved (Bell and Pospisil 2017, 1). The preeminent focus on a narrow set of elites reinforces this ten- dency of many peace agreements to create highly unsustainable political settlements. The absence of a discussion of longer-term development issues as a key dimension of these settlements is also often part of the problem. Translating a political settlement into a more sustainable process of constitu- tional change, institutional reform, and modiﬁ ed legal frameworks is complicated and often requires multiple iterations (Bell and Zulueta-Fülscher 2016). Ensuring that a political settlement is genuinely inclusive is essential to steering a society on a peaceful pathway, as it consti- tutes an important part of the process of renegotiating access to power among differ- ent groups. Democratic instruments and the electoral process are often insufﬁ cient to bring about the inclusion of excluded groups, especially excluded minority groups, in a sustainable manner.

At the national level, these forms include creating so-called “grand coalitions” of all major parties, as in Austria (Lijphart 2008); reserving political positions such as president and prime minister for certain religious communities, as in Lebanon (Bahout 2016); alternating the presidency between parties every four years, as in Colombia (Mazzuca and Robinson 2009); and setting quotas for marginalized groups in institutions, as in India (Gates et al. 2016). Inclusive elite bargains and the dis- tribution of positions of state power among different groups in Zambia since indepen- dence has helped to avoid violent conﬂ ict over the last decades in spite of the existence of multiple ﬁ ssures in society (Lindemann 2008). Other types of power sharing include security (military, police, or security forces), economic (access to resources or processes of decision making), and territorial (forms of territorial autonomy) arrangements (Hartzell and Hoddie 2006; Hoddie and Hartzell 2005).

Rather, they involve continual negoti- ating, bargaining, and contestation of rela- tions between elites over time and mediation of relations between elites and the broader society (Putzel and Di John 2012; World Bank 2011). While the long-term effects of power sharing on peace and stability are hard to discern, a substantial body of evidence sug- gests that power sharing helps to prevent recurrence of violent conﬂ ict (Putzel and Di John 2012; World Bank 2011) and is associated with greater stability overall (Gleditsch and Ruggeri 2010; Linder and Bächtiger 2005; Vreeland 2008). For example, in Africa, between 1970 and 1990, rulers faced a 72 percent chance of being forced out of ofﬁ ce under violent circum- stances, but after 1990 and owing in part to multiparty elections, the chance fell to 41 percent (Reno 2002). However, power sharing is not a guar- anteed means of addressing the underlying risks associated with exclusion. It has lim- itations and cannot easily adapt to chang- ing realities, for instance, such as when a change in structural factors prompts one group to seek an increase in its share of power (Call 2012).

Colombia’s National Front Pact between 1958 and 1974 helped to alleviate tensions between the Liberal and Conservative parties, but its exclusion of other groups contributed to the armed conﬂ ict there (Felter and Renwick 2017). As demographics or allegiances shift, actors might be reluctant to adapt power-sharing arrangements accordingly, as in Lebanon, where power sharing has contributed to a deadlock in the implementation of poli- cies, along with sectarian-based allocation of power and the resistance of political leaders to cede power (Bahout 2016; Rosiny 2016). If power is distributed according to group identity, the power-sharing arrange- ment can reinforce certain identities rela- tive to others and thus can negate the potential of these arrangements to mini- mize violent conﬂ ict. Translating a power-sharing arrange- ment into a new constitution after a con- ﬂ ict can lower the risk of violence recurrence. A cross-country study using the Comparative Constitutions Project database, which includes data on constitu- tions from all independent states over the years 1789–2015, ﬁ nds that the process of creating a new constitution after the con- clusion of violent conﬂ ict is associated with an approximately 60 percent reduc- tion in potential recurrence of violence (Elkins, Ginsburg, and Melton 2014).

This work also suggests that a constitutional process can serve as a means of addressing intergroup grievances and inequality, as in the peace process after the end of apartheid in South Africa (Samuels 2005). The chance of peace is enhanced when multiple forms of power sharing are adopted together (Jarstad and Nilsson 2008). Federalism, Decentralization, and Devolution Power-sharing arrangements often extend across multiple levels of governance through the transfer of power and resources to the subnational level. Some of the most common mechanisms for this are decen- tralization, devolution, and federalism, dis- cussed here in general terms. Chapter 6 provides more speciﬁ c examples of coun- tries that have overcome violent conﬂ ict by means of devolution and government restructuring. Decentralization refers to the process and result of structuring a system so that multiple layers share authority and deliver goods and services (Wolff, Ross, and Wee 2017).

Where ethnic, linguistic, religious, and cultural groups concentrate in distinct geographic regions, decentraliza- tion can reduce the potential for violence by addressing center-periphery tensions and accommodating diversity (USAID 2009). Subnational governance arrangements pro- posed as part of peace negotiations can sig- nal moderation by the majority and temper fears of the minority (Lake and Rothchild 2005). When further institutionalized in national law, such arrangements can help to protect the rights and interests of both minority and majority groups, to manage regional horizontal inequalities, and to ensure a balance of power among groups, thereby reducing the risk of violent conﬂ ict. Self-governance arrangements such as federalism have proven effective in many cases in reducing local violent conﬂ ict where there is horizontal inequality among groups, such as in Bangsamoro in Mindanao in the Philippines (Colletta and Oppenheim 2017). The effectiveness of self-rule is greatly enhanced when self-governance arrangements are paired with a proportional representation system that ensures that power is shared across groups (Neudorfer, Theuerkauf, and Wolff 2016) and when they are supported by sufﬁ cient guarantees against the recentral- ization of power (Lake and Rothchild 2005).

T erritorial self-governance in com- bination with a proportional representa- tion system “can improve the quality of governance, make government more responsive to minorities and disgruntled groups, and guarantee minority groups’ physical security and identity survival” (Nygård et al. 2017, 14). Power-sharing arrangements between national and subnational levels carry their own risks. Just as concentrating power in a centralized system can raise tensions, decentralizing or devolving power to the local level raises the stakes among local groups and creates new avenues for vio- lence. Devolution can exacerbate the risks of violence where local political parties reinforce ethnic identities, foster interethnic and intergroup tensions, and mobilize groups for violent conﬂ ict (Wolff, Ross, and Wee 2017). Chapter 6 focuses more speciﬁ - cally on the experience of decentralization as a peacebuilding strategy.

{"page": 183, "text": "What People Fight Over: Arenas of Contestation 147 While publicly linked to elite contesta- tion of outcomes or conﬁ dence in the result, elections can also trigger violence, especially in the presence of multiple preex- isting risks. Electoral violence is associated with long-standing and unresolved griev- ances (real or perceived). As elections, by deﬁ nition, produce winners and losers, they can fuel concerns that political or con- stitutional order will not respond to demands for reform. As discussed in chapter 2, the risk of election-related violence is ampliﬁ ed in ﬂ edgling democracies (Bates 2008; Gagnon 1994; Snyder 2000), where winner-take-all outcomes, real or perceived, can leave groups outside the circle of power (Chabal and Daloz 1999; Mamdani 1996). In certain cases, even attempts to amend the rules can lead to violence, as in Niger in 2010, when a military coup followed an attempt by the president to remain in power beyond the terms set by the constitution. The overriding responsibility for a suc- cessful election lies with political leaders, from both government and opposition par- ties. Incumbents and challengers can see elections as a chance to manipulate the sys- tem and structures to exclude rival groups and can use violence as a tactic to inﬂ uence the outcome, with different actors and mechanisms appearing in pre- and post- election violence.

Studies suggest that pre- election violence is more frequent than postelection conﬂ ict and is usually mobi- lized by actors in favor of an incumbent, often using the coercive apparatus of the state to retain power (Arriola and Johnson 2012, 10; Straus and Taylor 2012). Ensuring peaceful elections depends on how risks are managed. First, it is critical to foster conditions that avoid zero-sum poli- tics well before an election. This often requires managing exclusionary dynamics across arenas and beyond elections—for example, in the distribution of natural resources—as well as placing a premium on national leadership, to refrain from threats of violence or harassment of politi- cal opponents. Managing such dynamics may be particularly important when legal authority and political power are heavily concentrated and in presidential and semipresidential systems, which some studies show demonstrate greater risks of violence (Malik 2017). In contrast, electoral systems based on proportional representation are sometimes associated with fewer incidents of violence (Fiedler 2017; Mukherjee 2006).

In Sub- Saharan Africa, for example, countries with majoritarian (that is, so-called “ﬁ rst past the post”) electoral rules have a higher inci- dence of election-related violence (number of incidents) than countries with propor- tional electoral rules (Fjelde and Höglund 2016). Power-sharing agreements have also been shown to help to ensure that groups that lose an election nevertheless have meaningful representation in government, access to state resources, and some degree of autonomy (Brancati and Synder 2012). However, such power-sharing agreements, often struck between elites to manage a spe- ciﬁ c crisis, can undermine popular will and trust in the political system. Beyond individual leaders and forms of institutions, electoral processes matter. Often, election-related violence is inﬂ u- enced by perceptions of unfairness in how elections are managed and held. Elections are most likely to succeed when citizens have conﬁ dence that electoral results reﬂ ect their choices.

The potential for violence around elec- tions can also be managed through mecha- nisms for dialogue and transparency as part of a broader approach to promoting peace and stability. Responses to electoral violence are not necessarily, or exclusively, contin- gent on the quality of the electoral process itself. Most elections produce results that lead to acceptance even in the face of vary- ing degrees of imperfections. Nonstate actors and new media can play a role in defusing tensions. Civil society and private sector actors in Kenya during and after the violence of 2007–08 lobbied the warring parties to come together and acted as a channel for the views of the pub- lic (Lindenmayer and Kaye 2009).

T echnology can support early warning systems as well as efforts to counter hate speech and to improve communication between the gov- ernment and citizens (IDS 2017). Again, in Kenya, policy makers, citizens, and the government have used the Internet and communications tools, which played a destructive role in postelection violence in 2013 (IDS 2017), to raise awareness of, monitor, and respond to violence. The ﬁ ndings of electoral fraud may also create opportunities for violence in protest of the results, and independent electoral observers may announce aspects of elec- toral conduct that were previously not pub- lic, as in the 2005 legislative elections in Ethiopia. Similarly, studies highlight that the timing of elections inﬂ uences the risk of violence. Holding elections early in a politi- cal transition may increase the chance of violence because institutions are weak and trust is low (Brancati and Synder 2012). This risk has to be weighed against the ben- eﬁ t of elections, which is that that they tend to confer legitimacy on a new government when they are based on a sufﬁ ciently robust and inclusive political settlement.

The Arena of Land and Natural Resources Land-Related Disputes in T oday’s Conﬂ icts Land is deeply evocative. It is essential to personal and communal economic well- being, livelihoods, and identity. A major resource for most economies, land is part of the social fabric. Social control of land is central to most systems of governance. Even in cases where land has not played a direct role in violent conﬂ ict, the breakdown of institutions and societal structures during conﬂ ict can revive latent frustrations or a sense of unfairness around land and resources (Marc, V erjee, and Mogaka 2015). In the wake of conﬂ ict, land-related dis- putes can center on a clash of rights between returnees and current occupiers of the land (Maze 2014). Scholars have argued that conﬂ icts fought over land tend to be more prolonged, more stubborn to negotiation, and thus more likely to recur than conﬂ icts related to other arenas (Maze 2014). Violent conﬂ ict around land is typically stoked by grievances related to land scar- city, insecurity of tenure, and historical injustices.

This projected rise in violent conﬂ ict around land will be most evident across Africa, which already sees the bulk of land-related conﬂ ict (Bruce 2017). Urbanization is another global trend that may fuel conﬂ ict over land. Many soci- eties are already struggling to extend basic services and governance to rapidly growing populations in urban and peri-urban areas. This urbanization puts a strain on land and service delivery (ICRC 2016a, 2016b; World Bank 2010). The civil unrest in Ethiopia that began in late-2015 was underscored by tensions between the Oromian population and the seat of power in Addis Ababa. The expansion of the city into surrounding farmland reignited concerns among the Oromo population over their lack of con- trol in managing the suburbs that lie in Oromia and regarding fair compensation for land (Global Voices 2015).

In Liberia, numerous dis- putes over local landownership, com- pounded by the loss of land records during the civil war, remain unresolved (World Bank 2008). The recent surge in state sales of land is exacerbating tensions between local communities and the state and agri- business companies (Brown and Keating 2015). T enure insecurity also reﬂ ects the failure of the state to recognize customary or informal property rights. Women can be especially vulnerable to insecurity of tenure. Although women have legal entitlement to own land in some regions, they often continue to be denied land rights for political and cultural rea- sons. Under customary systems, women often have access to land only through a male intermediary. Women also have difﬁ - culty retaining land in the event of divorce or after the death of their husbands (Deininger and Castagnini 2006).

Nevertheless, there are examples of suc- cessful efforts to increase women’s access to land. In Rwanda, land-related issues con- tributed to the 1994 genocide (Gillingham and Buckle 2014). Consequently, to prevent further cycles of violence and to address grievances such as those related to ethnic division and gender discrimination in land access, the government moved to clarify land rights and launched a program of land tenure regularization (Gillingham and Buckle 2014). An assessment found that participants in the program doubled their investment in soil conservation, with a larger increase for females (Ali, Deininger, and Goldstein 2014). In addition, the pro- gram increased the tenure security of legally married women. In Peru, land titling pro- grams have enabled women to join the for- mal labor market, increasing income levels and reducing child labor (F ield 2007).

Pastoralists face particular challenges related to the right of passage. They rely on mobility to cope with variations in rainfall. Pastoral and agricultural livelihoods depend on mutually beneﬁ cial and negotiated non- exclusive access to water and reciprocal land use agreements. Conﬂ icts arise when access to waterpoints, grazing lands, and pastoral corridors are restricted and crops are dam- aged. Larger herd sizes and environmental degradation, as well as larger farms, espe- cially large agribusinesses, have increased the frequency and intensity of these conﬂ icts. In the Darfur region of Sudan, tensions between nomadic pastoralist herders and settled farmers over livestock migration routes and waterholes have become a ﬂ ashpoint for wider differences and have contributed to violent conﬂ ict there (Brown and Keating 2015; box 5.2).

A local governance system had evolved to mediate conﬂ icts over resources, facilitate farming and grazing on the same plots of land, and to accommodate new arrivals.

Each man received a hut and a plot of land to farm, while grazing rights and access to waterpoints remained communal. Nomads were given temporary access to land to enable them to reach grazing routes but were obligated to prevent crop damage. Migrants were also given land, and the terms of their stay were negotiated by the village sheik. The decline of central government control over the region stripped customary rulers of their authority to manage grazing patterns. Historically, once annual rainfall patterns became clear, customary authorities would meet to negotiate adjustments in the grazing patterns of different tribal groups. Comity was a key principle. A tribe struggling with poor rainfall would be allowed to use land in the territory ( dar) of another tribe, which in return had a reasonable expectation of receiving the same assistance in case of need.

However, the experience of reform and its success in preventing violent conﬂ ict vary by type of reform and context. Early experiences of land reform in East Asia were quite positive, while the experience in Latin America in the 1970s was more complex (Bruce 2017). Efforts to manage conﬂ ict and to prevent violent conﬂ ict related to land tend to be most effective where they combine the reform of land with more immediate con- ﬂ ict and dispute resolution measures. Supports involving the empowerment of communities, the improvement of land governance and administration, and the more effective resolutions of land disputes fall short of addressing the structural causes of conﬂ ict, yet they can manage tensions and help to avoid violence (Bruce 2017).

The efﬁ cacy of each reform needs to be examined individually. One type of reform is the resettlement of citizens onto public lands as a way of alleviating land pressure in densely populated areas (Bruce 2017). This often brings brief, if any, respite from competition over land and can be a signiﬁ - cant cause of conﬂ ict in itself, with new tensions emerging on the periphery in an attempt to address grievances at the center. Another type of reform is the regulation and reform of tenancy, which uses legisla- tion to improve the situation of tenants. T enancy reform can be an important step toward more meaningful reform, but on its own, it has largely failed as a comprehen- sive reform strategy. Programs of land titling and registration can be effective peacebuilding tools in post- conﬂ ict contexts.

Titling and registration can increase secu- rity of tenure and provide protection by recognizing full rights for communities under customary law. “Formalizing” the rights of informal settlers and customary landholders is widely accepted as being important for preventing conﬂ ict, although there is little agreement on when and how it should be implemented (Bruce 2017). The signiﬁ cant potential of these programs to prevent conﬂ ict relies on careful planning, implementation, and targeting. Experiences from Cambodia show that, while titling can bring about security of tenure, corruption in implementation can exclude vulnerable groups from the beneﬁ ts (Sekiguchi and Hatsukano 2013). In Cambodia, the pro- gram was ineffective where the risks of vio- lence were greatest (Cambodian Center for Human Rights 2013). Titling and registra- tion can also facilitate land grabs by making land more valuable. This has been a recur- rent risk in urban land reform, especially in slum-upgrading efforts. Land tenure reform prevents conﬂ ict by providing new land rights, but usually only as part of a broader package of reforms.

So-called “land to the tiller” reforms make land available to the people working it. These reforms either take land from landlords and provide tenants with titles to the land they have been farming or break up large farms. Such reforms usually come in response to escalating tenant demands for land and can be applied where tenancy reforms have failed.

Market-mechanism redistribution and community-based land reform rely on the government to facilitate the purchase and sale of land. The government provides credit to buyers; when the credit has been repaid, the land is titled to beneﬁ ciary households. This model is being imple- mented in Brazil, Malawi, and South Africa (Bruce 2017). This model presents less risk of conﬂ ict because it does not compel land- owners to sell land. In addition, agricultural land reform holds a much higher chance of success when accompanied by increased access to credit and markets for new landholders. In areas where this has not been the case, land reforms have been effectively reversed, as new land- owners face difﬁ culties in maintaining liveli- hoods or keeping up with property taxes. In El Salvador, unequal access to land was an important structural driver of the 12-year civil war and a critical area for the eventual peace accords (Binford 1993; Seligson 1995; Thiesenhusen 1995).

In urban areas, access to housing enables broader access to livelihoods. There are many and diverse examples of efforts to increase access to affordable housing. The state may provide low-cost housing directly, as in Brazil up until the 1980s, or it may offer subsidies to facilitate the purchase or rental of housing (Magalhaes 2016). Many countries throughout Latin America, including Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Mexico, and Peru, adopted these market-based approaches during the 1970s and 1980s, all with the strong participation of the private sector (Magalhaes 2016). Results have been mixed, with some countries experiencing a virtual reversal of the intended reforms toward even stronger segregation in slums (Magalhaes 2016).

Water-related contestations can take place at multiple levels: between herders and farmers over a shared waterpoint, between communities over allocation of irrigation water, between citizens and the state over the displacement impact of a new dam, and between neighboring states over the sharing of transnational waters. These disputes may also interconnect at different levels. For instance, local disputes over water may mir- ror, contribute to, and complicate wider disputes over water allocation (Brown and Keating 2015). Managing local-level dis- putes is thus as critical as resolving inter- state water-related confrontations. Improving access to water can help to promote women’s safety. In many societ- ies, gender-based divisions of work leave women with the primary responsibility for organizing and undertaking domestic work, including cooking, cleaning, and taking care of children and elderly family members—all of which require access to water (Cleaver and Elson 1995). Women are at risk of harassment and violence when fetching water.

Water scarcity is expected to cost some regions up to 6 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) by 2050 (World Bank 2016). The effects of scar- city are felt most keenly in the Middle East and North Africa, which has only 1 percent of the world’s renewable water resources despite hosting about 5 percent of the world’s population (Pedraza and Heinrich 2016). Often, it is not the scarcity of water that leads to tensions, but the way in which it is gov- erned and administered. Inefﬁ cient use and management of water, outdated infrastruc- ture, and inappropriate legal, political, and economic frameworks all exacerbate ten- sions arising from the scarcity of water (Pedraza and Heinrich 2016). Climate change is a “threat multiplier which exacerbates existing tensions and instability” and magniﬁ es the challenge of managing the resource (EU 2008). The impacts of climate change will be detected primarily through water use, creating uncertainty in food, energy, urban, and environmental systems (World Bank 2016).

Risks of violence around water are more pronounced at the local or subnational levels than at the national level (Gleick 1993; Postel and Wolf 2001). However, relatively few mechanisms are available for managing sub- national contestations around water. One local option is dialogue among stakeholders facilitated by civil society (OECD 2005). Where dialogue occurs, actions should situate the conﬂ ict in the broader context of prevailing power and political arrangements. Increasing women’s participation in gover- nance of water is particularly important, given the links between access to water and women’s safety and the improved sustain- ability of projects that involve women as key stakeholders (UN Water 2006). An understanding of shared needs and mutual concern over water supplies may encourage cooperation in water sharing between different communities or coun- tries.

Disputes between riparian states can be resolved through consulta- tions, mediation, negotiation, and judicial means, such as recourse to the International Court of Justice (Strategic Foresight Group 2013). T echnology can also help to manage the risks around the scarcity of water by ﬁ nding innovative ways in which to reuse and recycle water. Desalination and repro- cessing of sewage water are two examples of how technology can help to manage the supply of water. However, conﬂ ict over water is infre- quent at the international level, and in most cases, countries share transboundary water resources without violence (Wolf et al. 2006). Relations among riparian states tend to be more cooperative in the presence of international water institutions that can accommodate changing political, hydrolog- ical, or other basin conditions (Ho 2017).

The Challenge of Extractive Resources Extractive resources have developed a repu- tation as being a poisoned chalice for eco- nomic and institutional stability and peace. While resources such as oil, natural gas, and minerals have the potential to confer signif- icant beneﬁ ts onto populations and to improve development outcomes, they can also fuel tremendous instability and vio- lence. This combination of risks of violence together with the opportunity for increased revenue and development, known as the “resource curse, ” has a large inﬂ uence on the pathway a society takes (Drew 2017). Simply put, the economic beneﬁ ts of natu- ral resource extraction create incentives for competition that, if well managed, can be directed toward broader society. If not well managed, the beneﬁ ts concentrate among speciﬁ c groups, with the potential to fuel violent conﬂ ict. Research suggests that 40–60 percent of intrastate armed conﬂ icts over the past 60 years have been triggered, funded, or sustained by natural resources (Brown and Keating 2015, 4; Drew 2017; Matthew, Brown, and Jensen 2009). 5 Violence related to extractive resources can take place at the national an"}

It can take many forms, rang- ing from community-based contestations over the access to proﬁ ts from extraction or its environmental impacts to civil war that is funded by resources open to being looted. The degree of risk of conﬂ ict over natural resources depends, in part, on the type of resource, its location, and the mode of exploitation (Lujala 2010; Ross 2012). The connection between minerals, includ- ing alluvial diamonds (Lujala 2009; Ross 2003, 2006), other alluvial gemstones (Fearon 2004), and other nonfuel minerals (Besley and Persson 2011; Collier, Hoefﬂ er, and Rohner 2009; Sorens 2011), and the risk of violent conﬂ ict has been especially pronounced. The destructive potential of misappro- priated, misused, and poorly managed extractive resources has been under scru- tiny since the beginning of the so-called “greed versus grievance” debate of the last decade and even before (Drew 2017). Greed was argued to provide both the opportunity and the cause of conﬂ ict (Collier and Hoefﬂ er 2004), while grievance as a motiva- tion was said to derive from a sense of injus- tice and the complex interplay of factors that led to violent conﬂ ict (Homer-Dixon"}

While this debate has since become more nuanced, extractive resources can contribute to the risk of violence, both directly and indirectly, in several ways. Whether a society rich in natural resources follows a peaceful pathway or not depends on how the associated risks are managed.

Extractives may be both a structural facilitator of such regimes and a focal point for group-based grievances where the perception of an unfair distribution of beneﬁ ts is felt to reﬂ ect an unjust social contract (Drew 2017). This is especially the case in the absence of fair, robust, and competent gov- erning institutions that are able to deter cor- ruption or respond to the seizure of resources by powerful actors. The capture of resources by elites, which deprives the general population of revenues and the potential development opportuni- ties they may have derived from these revenues, is a major source of grievance. Diverting revenues from resources can fuel tensions, especially when combined with corruption and mismanagement or where revenues beneﬁ t only certain groups and exclude others. In this case, the “unrealized potential” of extractives revenues to increase opportunities for all and contribute to development can feed into preexisting grievances (Le Billon 2014).

Oil-dependent states sometimes become rentier states charac- terized by authoritarianism, repression, poor governance, and high levels of corruption. Oil, in particular, makes corruption more entrenched and authori- tarian regimes more durable (Ross 2015). In countries where political elites have captured resources, the exclusion of speciﬁ c ethnic communities from patronage net- works can deepen economic inequalities, create distortions in the political process, and weaken political systems (Sargsyan 2017). States can also use extractives as concessions to ﬁ nance violent conﬂ ict, while royalties and bonus payments made to repressive or unaccountable govern- ments by transnational companies can support counterinsurgency or suppress dissent (Ballentine and Nitzschke 2004). The risk of violent conﬂ ict tends to rise in the presence of so-called “lootable” resources and those that can be extracted with relatively little access to technology or capital, such as alluvial diamonds, gem- stones, or hydrocarbons (Drew 2017).

Some armed movements are primarily rent seeking; others are pri- marily political, religious, or ideological; and many have mixed or shifting motives, for example, when economic incentives supplant a group’s original aims. The exis- tence of these sources of income for armed groups and organized crime networks can prolong and entrench violent conﬂ ict. At the local level, land and natural resources often constitute the primary means of income and livelihood for com- munities. This creates high stakes for con- testation over resources. Often, conﬂ ict stems from grievances where communities are excluded from decisions about extraction or where the distribution of project beneﬁ ts is perceived to be unfair or unequal. Grievances can coalesce around the envi- ronmental impacts of extraction, especially if these are perceived to fall disproportion- ately on certain groups. In Nigeria, environ- mental degradation associated with oil extraction has impinged on the livelihoods of local ﬁ shermen and farmers in the Niger delta and contributed to oil-related violent conﬂ ict over the last two decades (Marc, V erjee, and Mogaka 2015).

While service delivery is not the only determinant of state legitimacy, 9 it is a primary way by which many citizens directly encounter the state and shapes their overall perception of it. In the hierarchy of political goods, the relevance of services has been referred to as giving “content to the social contract between the ruler and ruled” (Rotberg 2004). Speciﬁ cally, the delivery of education, health care, water, sanitation, and even justice and security have been described as “the glue” that binds state and society together (Milliken and Krause 2002). These services are the most tangible expression of the basic minimum that citi- zens expect from the state in exchange for their deference to the state’s rule over them (Gilley 2009).

Uneven coverage of services can under- mine state legitimacy, when it is viewed as a manifestation of group exclusion. Perceptions of unequal or exclusionary access to services inﬂ uence the way citizens regard the “right- fulness” of the state (Dix, Hussmann, and Walton 2012). According to one study, patronage politics in Sri Lanka has meant that poorer and less well-connected individu- als fail to access social protection transfers as a result of a bargain forged among wealthier and more powerful members of society (Nixon, Mallett, and McCullough 2017). In Colombia, Liberia, and Nepal, unequal or exclusionary access to public goods has also been detrimental to perceptions of state legit- imacy (Dix, Hussmann, and Walton 2012). In these cases, uneven service delivery can stoke grievances against the state or against groups that are seen to be receiving unfairly disproportionate access.

Perceived favoritism toward one group may boost the favored group’s trust in the state, but also it may undermine other groups’ trust in the state (Mcloughlin 2015a). Reforms of ser- vice delivery can generate grievances that lead to violent conﬂ ict “when the rules and patterns of distribution are perceived by some to be unjustiﬁ able and unfair” (Sturge et al. 2017, ix). The legitimizing effect of service delivery also depends heavily on how services are delivered. A ﬁ ve-country study of citizen perceptions and service delivery in conﬂ ict- affected contexts ﬁ nds that, with regard to state legitimacy, fairness and inclusiveness in the service delivery process matters as much as, if not more than, the quality of services or who delivers them (Sturge et al. 2017). Similarly, other research across dif- ferent contexts ﬁ nds that “the perceived fairness of the process by which authorities and institutions make decisions and exer- cise authority is a key aspect of people’s willingness to comply with it” (Mcloughlin 2015a; Tyler 2006).

This can lead to civil unrest, protests, and even outright violence, as in South Africa’s informal settlements in 2009 (Burger 2009; Corruption Watch 2014). In Nepal, corruption, lack of information about the availability of services, and the exclusion of some groups from their share undermined the credibility of the state institutions (Ndaruhutse et al. 2012). Where corruption is endemic, political legitimacy is weakened and the risk of conﬂ ict rises (Baker 2017). At its simplest, corruption is deﬁ ned as the misuse of public ofﬁ ces and resources for private gain (Sargsyan 2017). However, corruption can occur at different levels and in many different forms. Corruption has an indirect connection to violence in that it can fuel grievances between groups that are seen to be beneﬁ ting and those that are not. Additionally, corruption ulti- mately undermines national institutions and social norms because some are seen to be above the rules set by those institu- tions (World Bank 2011). In combination with weak rule of law and where the insti- tutions charged with delivering services are politicized or captured, corruption can generate popular “distrust, dissatis- faction, and grievances with the existing political system” (Taydas, Pekse"}

These feelings can contrib- ute to delegitimizing the state and invali- dating disincentives for violent protest (Sargsyan 2017). In Afghanistan, endemic corruption and elite impunity under- mined the image of the government and was one of the factors that enabled the resurgence of the Taliban in the country- side (World Bank 2017a). Some research suggests that corruption can have a stabilizing role, depending on the context and the form it takes (Hussmann, Tisne, and Mathisen 2009). “Classic” patronage politics can be a source of social and political cohesion, in that it promotes a certain consistency (Brinkerhoff and Goldsmith 2005) and trying to elimi- nate it can destabilize power dynamics (Hameiri 2007). In certain cases, public investments can enhance inclusive service delivery, despite the presence of corrup- tion. In the midst of armed conﬂ ict in Nepal, Maoists allowed health services to operate in exchange for rents, and district- level ofﬁ cials understood that they needed to maintain the ﬂ ow of medicine to villages to enhance their local legitimacy (World Bank 2017a).

Service Delivery in Alternatively Governed Spaces As discussed in chapter 3, nonstate actors often provide alternative forms of gover- nance, especially in areas where the state has not established its presence in a convincing way. These actors may be traditional or communal leaders and institutions that step in to ﬁ ll the vacuum, or they may include criminal networks, trafﬁ ckers, militants, and extremists. While not all of the latter may directly oppose the state, they may undermine the state, either indirectly by supplanting the state’s authority or more directly by using these spaces to launch attacks, build up operations, and trafﬁ c nar- cotics, arms, and contraband. The dominant narrative across such contexts is to “securitize” these spaces, to link them to multiple emerging security threats, and to view them as safe havens for rogue elements (Abrahamsen 2005; Keenan 2008). While one of the state’s primary responsibilities is to provide security, a purely security-focused approach in such contexts is often ineffective. It fails to address the core reason that such spaces emerge in the ﬁ rst place: namely, poor gov- ernance and weak state presence (Keister 2014).

Building state legitimacy requires, among other measures, the visible presence of state institutions, also referred to as “pen- etration” (Nixon, Mallett, and McCullough 2017, 4). Often, however, the state chooses to allocate limited resources in a rational manner, only extending authority when the beneﬁ ts outweigh the costs. The state may decide not to integrate areas where its pres- ence is already low or weak if integration promises few beneﬁ ts and meager returns on the investment (Keister 2014). For exam- ple, limited infrastructure and ﬁ scal con- straints in the north of Mali, along with high per capita cost of services in propor- tion to low population density, make the delivery of services very expensive and chal- lenging (Wee et al. 2014). However, a grow- ing sense of marginalization among the local population (despite data showing that service provision in some sectors is compat- ible with or higher than in the south) neces- sitates ﬁ nding innovative ways to deliver services (Wee et al. 2014).

A policy of “peaceful penetration” in Pakistan between 1951 and 1955 and between 1972 and 1977 saw the government provide Pashtun areas with a variety of development projects to demonstrate the value of closer relations with the government; this helped to lessen the appeal of an independent Pashtunistan and to improve citizens’ perceptions of the government (Keister 2014). Using existing structures that emerge locally and organi- cally to form the “building blocks” of administration in areas such as the remote regions of Somalia can also be effective (Bryden 1999; Keister 2014). The extension of authority and legiti- macy through local intermediaries in this way forms “mediated states” or “hybrid regimes” (Boege et al. 2008; Keister 2014, 9; Menkhaus 2006, 7). Hybrid arrangements can involve public and private as well as for- mal and informal arrangements. These arrangements can be effective in remote communities with a high level of diversity, helping service delivery to adapt to local preferences and building trust between the center and the periphery.

Inclusion and Consultation in Service Delivery Providing a platform for inclusion, partici- pation, and voice to citizens and involving them directly in the provision of services can signiﬁ cantly improve citizens’ percep- tions of the state. Citizens’ perceptions of and regard for the state, particularly at the local level, are improved when they are con- sulted, when they feel heard, and, most important, when they are brought directly into the process itself (Sturge et al. 2017). The presence of grievance mechanisms and possibilities of civil participation strongly inﬂ uence perceptions of government, which suggests that public services can act as a channel through which citizens and public authorities interact (Van de Walle and Scott 2011). In Nepal, Pakistan, and Uganda, includ- ing citizens in the process of service deliv- ery through grievance mechanisms improved the perceptions among citizens of national actors and reinforced feelings that both local and national government actors care about the opinion of citizens (Sturge et al. 2017).

Although problematic service delivery can also negatively affect attitudes to and rela- tionships with both local-level service pro- viders and the government, embedding grievance mechanisms into the service can have the opposite effect (Nixon, Mallett, and McCullough 2017).

Experiences of corruption in service delivery and poor treatment by staff, especially when repeated, undermine trust in the capacity of govern- ment to provide decent care. In Sierra Leone, decentralization of service delivery was intended to give local communities a greater say and stake in outcomes (Sacks and Larizza 2012). However, this was insuf- ﬁ cient in and of itself for building trust in local authorities. What beneﬁ ciaries cared about in reality was how fair and free of corruption they perceived the process to be, combined with the quality of services (Sacks and Larizza 2012). The state can gain legiti- macy by fencing in disagreements, opening up space for voice and arbitration, provid- ing services in a fair and inclusive manner, and offering institutionalized arrangements for service provision.

Severe deﬁ cits in the governance of this arena, including lack of accountability, transparency, and respon- siveness, can result in a breakdown in the rule of law and, consequently, impunity. If rules and norms regarding violence are dis- criminatory or poorly enforced, groups may cease to rely on institutionalized secu- rity and justice sectors and may seek secu- rity and justice elsewhere (World Bank 2011). These issues are speciﬁ cally addressed in the 2030 Agenda. SDG 16 emphasizes effective, accountable, transparent, and inclusive institutions and speciﬁ cally aims to reduce all forms of violence (target 16.1), particularly against children (target 16.2), and to promote the rule of law and ensure equal access to justice for all (target 16.3).

The Role of the Security Sector in Sustaining Peace The monopoly of the use of force is a main characteristic of the state’s authority, and the state almost always has a strong role in governance and the provision of security, even if this role is uneven across a country’s territory. The state cannot delegate security functions to nonstate actors without even- tually sacriﬁ cing sovereignty. Nevertheless, hybrid models, with mixed arrangements of informal, nonstate, and formal state security providers, are the norm in many low-capacity contexts, for example, rural Liberia, where community watch teams constitute a large component of security provision.

Where security actors do not behave in a manner consistent with the rule of law, they can pose a threat to the very popula- tions they are charged with protecting (World Bank 2011). Noting the trends in violent conﬂ ict elaborated in chapter 1, this section focuses largely on internal security forces, for example, police, gendarmes, and wildlife forces. However, even if designed to man- age external security, military forces can nonetheless have signiﬁ cant direct and indirect impacts on the prevention of con- ﬂ ict. While very few military regimes remain in place in the world, the military still plays a very strong role in politics and the economy in many countries. In some cases, this situation can be a source of sta- bility, especially when the army manages to stay out of political inﬁ ghting. However, military penetration of society and the economy can make reform of the security sector itself challenging.

As noted, where the state’s presence is weak or the authority of the state is con- tested, nonstate security providers and informal mechanisms can proliferate and become the preferred alternative for local populations. 10 Such nonstate providers can take many shapes and often change form over time, including as rogue local-level units of formal security institutions, crimi- nal gangs, violence entrepreneurs, rebel groups, self-defense militias, or vigilante groups. In some fragile contexts, there is no clear distinction between state and nonstate security providers, with the relationship of armed groups to state security forces chang- ing and evolving over time. The shifting alliances in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where rebels were integrated into the armed forces, only to revert to their established practices and structures once they returned home, are a case in point (Stearns 2012). In other contexts, the proliferation of nonstate armed groups and formal provid- ers of security can fragment the provision of security.

In many countries, political elites essentially arm private militias to garner power and inﬂ uence around key moments, such as elections. Even when managed by formal institu- tions, security actors—be they police units, individual patrols, or intelligence ofﬁ cers—are motivated by a range of political, social, cultural, and economic incentives. Exclusionary and biased secu- rity forces pose an especially high risk if access to and control of the tools to main- tain security are instead used to maintain loyalty or dispense favors. Although the state should provide security, as a service, to its citizens, it may use security forces less to further the public good than to defend its own power and protect allied private interests.

As discussed in chapter 4, abuse of identity groups by security forces will deepen grievances and may be a strong factor motivating people to identify with and join violent groups. The overall risk of weak, fragmented, exclusionary, or predatory security provi- sion is popular disenchantment and loss of conﬁ dence in a society’s willingness and ability to deliver security. Reform of the security sector, understood as the struc- tures, institutions, and personnel responsi- ble for managing, providing, and overseeing security, including informal or traditional security providers, can build the credibil- ity, legitimacy, and effectiveness of a society. 11 When security services have no legitimacy, they will struggle to be effective, and that effort will further undermine their credibility and delegitimize them in the eyes of the population. Reform of security institutions can sig- nal a change in approach, even when results from such reforms require sustained invest- ment. From its beginnings in the mid- 1990s, lessons on security sector reform (SSR) highlight three key entry points for reform: (a) the development of an institu- tional framework of organizations and pol- icies; (b) governance and civilian oversight; and (c) the establishment of capable, pro- fessional, and accountable security forces.

In addition to security sector reforms, demilitarization of society is also import- ant. In recognition of the critical nexus between security and development, SSR processes have sometimes been undertaken in conjunction with disarmament, demobi- lization, and reintegration (DDR) pro- grams, especially in postconﬂ ict countries. The DDR-SSR nexus is manifested in the integration of former combatants into national security and defense forces, at both the strategic and operational levels. Some countries tie development goals speciﬁ cally to security goals or develop joint programs for security and development, for example, through integrated rule of law and DDR programs. 12 If done effectively, DDR and SSR provide vital support to peace agree- ments and other transitional agreements by building conﬁ dence in postconﬂ ict institu- tions and processes.

First, the term justice refers to “the broadly held notion of fairness, ” which, despite differences in context, is a univer- sally relevant, albeit subjective, concept relating to just processes and outcomes regarding the distribution of power, resources, opportunities, and sanctions. A perception of unfairness is a key aspect of the relationship between grievances and mobilization to violence, as discussed in chapter 4. Second, the institutional side of justice refers to “the institutions that are central to resolving conﬂ icts arising over alleged violations or different interpretations of the rules that societies create to govern members’ behavior and that, as a conse- quence, are central to strengthening the normative framework (laws and rules) that shapes public and private actions” (World Bank 2011).

The distinction is important, in that it is possible for a regime to act in accordance with the rule of law for its particular context and still violate, and be accountable to, the interna- tional system of justice. Lack of legal identity is a major cause of exclusion from justice, and target 16.9 of the 2030 Agenda focuses speciﬁ cally on providing legal identity for all, including birth registration, by 2030. Approximately 12 million people globally are stateless and without effective citizenship rights. 18 In addition, some 27 states around the world do not allow women to transfer nationality to their children, and statelessness can occur where fathers are stateless, missing, or deceased. For example, the Rohingya are Muslims living in Rakhine (historically known as Arakan) State, a geographically isolated area in western Myanmar, border- ing Bangladesh.

The justice system, especially the formal justice system, is the space where rules and power are ultimately deﬁ ned. These rules protect the basic rights that allow individuals to enjoy the beneﬁ ts from the other arenas. The justice system is the ultimate guarantor of the right to physical integrity, which underlies all other rights through the sanc- tions it imposes on violators. Most govern- ments have strong written policies that guarantee the right to physical integrity, which includes the right of protection from extrajudicial killing, torture, political or wrongful imprisonment, or enforced disap- pearance (box 5.6). If the state violates these rights or tolerates impunity for their viola- tion, it can exacerbate grievances, particularly when these manifestations of injustice over- lap with perceptions of exclusion, unfairness, or inequality (Cingranelli et al. 2017). By extension, access to the justice arena partly determines fair access to the other arenas.

Put another way, the credibility and legitimacy of the justice system has an impact on the functioning of other arenas and on the population’s per- ceptions of fairness and legitimacy overall. Durable institutions that are perceived as just are crucial to broad-based, inclusive development (World Bank 2011). The 2030 Agenda includes targets on equal access both to natural resources (targets 1.4, 2.3, 5a) and to justice (target 16.3). A robust justice system creates incentives for peaceful behavior.

The primary responsibility for respecting, protecting, and fulﬁ lling human rights rests with states, who translate the international norms into laws, policies, and programs. In many states, human rights have also underpinned institutional reforms—for example, constitutional reforms, creation of national human rights institutions, or transitional justice mechanisms. National human rights institutions serve as mechanisms, independent from government, for monitoring respect for human rights nationally. Civil society organizations have made vital contributions to human rights instruments and their implementation. International tools like fact-ﬁ nding missions, routine reporting, investigative commissions, and special rapporteurs have often focused on maintaining dialogue with governments on violations of rights, discrimination, and abuse as part of efforts to reduce the risks of conﬂ ict.

Conversely, a breakdown of justice systems and the rule of law generally can inﬂ ame the grievances that may be mobi- lized for conﬂ ict and create incentives for violent behavior. 19 The relationship between weak rule of law and violence is under- scored by the poor perceptions of justice systems often found in regions suffering from or at risk of violent conﬂ ict, as people lose conﬁ dence in institutions that cannot, or will not, protect them from injustices (Logan 2017). Grievances can accumulate with prolonged conﬂ ict, as the capacity of justice systems is strained by the need to respond to ongoing violence; the often- elevated levels of criminality and abuses during violent conﬂ ict can further weaken the capacity of formal justice stystems. Prevention of violent conﬂ ict requires identifying why justice system processes and outcomes may discriminate against certain groups. In many cases, the formal justice sys- tem may be inaccessible. In others, it may be irrelevant to the justice-related needs of the population. Many people rely, voluntarily or out of necessity, on informal or customary justice systems that are rooted in traditional authority.

Indeed, this is the case for roughly 80 percent of the population in transition or postconﬂ ict settings (UN 2017). A cross-country study of Afghanistan, Guatemala, Iraq, Liberia, Mozambique, South Sudan, and Timor-Leste ﬁ nds that customary systems are often more trusted and used by people because they are more sensitive to the political and social realities and therefore faster and more effective in solving the every- day problems that people face (Isser 2011). Also, where formal rules diverge greatly from local norms and customs, these customary systems of justice are much more likely to be respected (Isser 2011). Any reform of the formal system can undermine public conﬁ dence in the justice system—and in the state more generally—if it does not engage meaningfully with infor- mal and customary justice systems. Time and again, experience has shown the critical importance, especially in countries transi- tioning out of violent conﬂ ict, of under- standing the role that customary systems play in responding to the problems people face. Reforms that fail to recognize this context may waste time and resources in building a formal system that the population later rejects and may also deepen resentment of the overall project of state building (Isser 2011).

An important ﬁ rst step is to understand how people are solving the problems they face and the role that customary institu- tions play in those processes. This under- standing helps to identify the gap between the way laws and policies are written, on the one hand, and the way conﬂ icts are resolved and needs are met in reality, on the other hand. Starting with understanding as a point of departure challenges the notion that legal authority needs to originate in the state. It also opens up the possibility for more inclusive and credible processes and offers the potential to anticipate trade-offs and unintended consequences. In many contexts, including in contexts where vio- lent conﬂ ict has already begun, local-level mechanisms for resolving conﬂ icts have helped to ensure stability and to reduce vio- lence. In the 1990s, the Islamic Courts in Somalia started to develop a level of popu- lar legitimacy, and by 2006, various armed groups were using the principle of credible law and order to form an Islamic Courts Union, which increased the stability in the territories under their control (Barnes and Hassan 2007; box 5.7).

On the one hand, it is important to ensure that current challenges receive equitable attention in order to build trust and reestablish a sense of nor- malcy. At the same time, particularly in postconﬂ ict environments, perpetrators must be equally held to account for past abuses in order to send a strong signal of change. Balancing these needs is one of the most formidable challenges of conﬂ ict- affected environments. Weighing the equal- ity of accountability processes against the imperative to bring perpetrators to book is critical to the challenge of advancing stabi- lization and justice in conﬂ ict-affected environments under SDG 16 (UN General Assembly 2015b). Accountability processes"}
{"page": 204, "text": "168 Pathways for Peace may exacerbate grievances related to spe- ciﬁ c social groups if they are perceived to discriminate between groups (Mahony 2015a). How and why the real or perceived unequal treatment of social groups actu- ally occurs varies from one process to another. Frameworks to identify how accountability processes treat groups dif- ferently can help to identify ways in which to preempt spoilers and mitigate risks of conﬂ ict (Mahony 2016). Responding to current needs implies expanding access to justice, especially for those who have been excluded. Strengthening the capacity of local-level mechanisms to resolve disputes that originate in the other arenas, as discussed in previous sections of this chapter, can go a long way toward build- ing conﬁ dence. For example, promoting more effective resolution of local-level con- ﬂ icts over land or water access helps to address the everyday problems people face. It also builds useful bridges between customary or informal and formal processes. Strengthening the capacity of formal institu- tions to process judicial caseloads and increasing the efﬁ ciency of investigations and prosecutions also need to be prioritized (World Bank 2011).

{"page": 204, "text": "11). Addressing everyday justice needs also entails dealing with manifestations of vio- lence that tend to increase in situations of violent conﬂ ict, especially common crime and domestic violence. In some contexts, efforts to address this violence draw on cus- tomary norms to challenge the rules and practices of formal institutions. For example, women’s advocacy groups in India’s Gujarat and Utter Pradesh states set up informal women’s courts (nari adalat) as an alternative to formal systems for resolving domestic violence cases (Kethineni, Srinivasan, and Kakar 2016). By drawingon community norms, international human rights laws, and state laws, they were able to expand access to justice and help to prevent further violence by contesting unequal gen- der power structures (Merry 2012; World Bank 2017c). Promoting accountability is pursued through transitional justice measures. 20 These include a wide range of mechanisms, such as vetting of government agencies and especially security forces, truth and reconciliation commissions, public apolo- gies, 21 memorialization or local healing processes, prosecution of human rights abuses, and material or symbolic repara- tions. 22 In some cases, transitional justice measures enable high-level prosecutions to take place.

BOX 5.7 Traditional versus Formal Justice in Somalia The formal court system in Somalia is perceived to be expensive, inaccessible, and prone to manipulation. Somalis rely primarily on traditional or clan-based forums to resolve disputes (xeer). Traditional elders are usually central to any kind of conﬂ ict resolution or justice service, relying primarily on the authority of their clan or militia to enforce their judgments. This appears to be true even in urban areas, where people can choose to use the formal court system. The lack of courts in rural areas means that there is little choice of forum. In Benadir region, payments required to process a case are higher than the legally mandated court fees, and court users report that judicial decisions are often subject to political and economic pressures. A real or perceived lack of judicial independence, including a clan- based appointment process, limits the ability of those who do not fall under the protection of a dominant clan and who are from vulnerable or marginalized groups (such as women or internally displaced persons) to access a"}

{"page": 205, "text": "What People Fight Over: Arenas of Contestation 169 There is widespread debate over the value of transitional justice measures in reducing the risks of conﬂ ict recurrence, in part due to the range of actions included in this category (Mallinder and O’Rourke 2016; Thoms, Ron, and Paris 2010). Some have argued that prosecutions for past crimes are essential to preventing conﬂ ict recurrence because they create deterrents for spoilers (Sikkink 2011); others argue that mechanisms to appease spoilers, such as amnesty, are more effective (Snyder and Vinjamuri 2003). The Transitional Justice Research Collaborative examines the relationships between ﬁ ve variables—trials, truth com- missions, amnesties, reparations, and vetting—that have been implemented following 119 transitions from authoritar- ian rule or civil war in 86 countries since 1970 (Payne et al. 2017). It ﬁ nds that implementing domestic criminal prosecu- tions 23 for past human rights violations has a signiﬁ cant relationship with nonrecur- rence of intrastate conﬂ ict. It also ﬁ nds that the rate of recurrence decreases by approximately 70 percent when trials are pursued of middle- and low-level actors (Payne et al. 2017), holding all other fac- tors constant.

Paradoxically, the prosecu- tion of high-ranking individuals is associated with a 65 percent increase in the rate of conﬂ ict recurrence, suggesting that “coming together after a war to initiate a major legal process (much like writing a new constitution) has important effects” (Payne et al. 2017, 19). The number of cases of international criminal justice engagement with country situations is insufﬁ cient to make statisti- cally signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings about their impact on conﬂ ict recurrence or nonrecurrence (Payne et al. 2017). The International Criminal Court defers jurisdiction to states that are able and willing to prosecute international crimes domestically. There is debate over whether this relationship to domestic processes prompts improved domestic trials or if it enables governments to engage in selective prosecution targeting speciﬁ c social groups while avoiding others (Hyeran and Simmons 2014; Mahony 2015b). Although the relationship between peace and justice has been debated, the focus of debate has generally been the will- ingness of spoilers to reengage in violence in response to the threat of prosecution (Vinjamuri 2010).

This implies accounting for the multiple roles and experiences of women during conﬂ ict as combatants, vic- tims of violence, widows, or mothers whose children die (Tabak 2011). It is also import- ant to consider the challenges that women, after a conﬂ ict, face in accessing livelihoods, recovering from physical and emotional trauma, and obtaining justice. In many cases, focusing on sexual violence as the sole form of violence women face during con- ﬂ ict ignores nonconﬂ ict-related violence and its impacts. Similar debates exist over the effective- ness of truth-telling processes as part of transitional justice (Mendeloff 2009). A recent quantitative study ﬁ nds that cer- tain truth-telling and reconciliation pro- cesses are associated with a decline in mental health, but higher levels of social integration (Cilliers, Dube, and Siddiqi 2016). Some qualitative studies, moreover, suggest that deeply contested narratives associated with truth telling may revive societal cleavages (Kelsall 2005).

Transitional justice measures can have a broader impact on social relationships. Some measures have been used to engage with pre- viously marginalized communities or seces- sionist movements in order to address political polarization and prevent an out- break.

These processes have arguably played a signiﬁ cant role in preventing the violent conﬂ ict that accompanied some other Arab Spring transitions. Some transi- tional justice processes were less effective in preventing violence overall but have pro- vided a model for future mechanisms to alle- viate social and political polarization. For example, exploration of historical injustice over more than 200 years, including state expropriation of land of the Bangsamoro community in Mindanao, the Philippines, was part of the comprehensive peace agree- ment in 2014. Conclusion Most violent conﬂ icts today play out in four arenas of contestation where groups in soci- ety negotiate access to power, resources, ser- vices, and security. As the spaces where access to the means of livelihood and well-being are deﬁ ned and defended, these arenas are critical sites of both risk and opportunity. Governance of these arenas in large part shapes a society’s pathway. As demonstrated in chapters 3 and 4, risk is heightened where shocks interact with underlying grievances.

Actors who are already at the table must agree to change the rules, institutions, or structural factors that deﬁ ne the power balance in the arenas, and they may see little beneﬁ t in challenging the status quo. Preventing violent conﬂ ict requires tar- geted, ﬂ exible, and sustained attention to all of the arenas. When the risks of violent con- ﬂ ict build up across arenas of contestation, an effective state has a responsibility to ensure that conﬂ icts and contestations remain nonviolent and that the outcome is conducive to the well-being of all citizens. Even if improving institutions can take decades, states can play an important role by signaling that they are focusing on equal access to political process, natural resources, services, security, and justice irrespective of sex, age, region of domicile, ethnicity, reli- gion, or other group identity. National plans to implement the 2030 Agenda can be useful in that regard. This aspect of the role of the state is at the heart of the social con- tract that ties citizens to the state.

Conﬂ ict in the security and justice arena poses particular challenges for prevention. These challenges are discussed in greater detail in chapter 6, which reviews the expe- riences of countries that have managed conﬂ ict. They relate to actors’ political and physical survival; as such, security and jus- tice reforms have proven sensitive and politically charged. Domestic actors in countries that have successfully made changes have had to make risky trade-offs. Short-term capability has been sacriﬁ ced for the potential of longer-term effective- ness. Reforms focused on inclusivity, trans- parency, accountability, and management of security institutions have boosted the resilience and legitimacy of the state. Reform of any institution is a long-term exercise. In the case of security and justice institutions, it usually takes roughly 5–10 years for signiﬁ cant and noticeable improvements in effectiveness and account- ability to become evident (DCAF 2017).

{"page": 219, "text": "Country Approaches to Preventing Violent Conflict 183 CHAPTER 6 Country Approaches to Preventing Violent Conﬂ ict The pathway to peace or conﬂ ict for each society is unique. The previous chapters introduce a framework explaining how societies create and maintain pathways via the unique interplay of structural factors, institutions, and actors. This chapter reviews the experience of countries that have avoided violent conﬂ ict, prevented its escalation, or rebuilt peace afterward. Drawing on the 19 country case studies prepared for this study, this chapter draws out several commonalities from the experi- ences of countries that have successfully prevented violence, interrupted its escala- tion, or avoided its recurrence. 1 This chap- ter draws on country examples in several ways, including through a ﬁ ne slicing of the country cases to apply to a particular aspect of prevention and illustrate a speciﬁ c point and through a more integrated examination of selected cases—presented in text boxes— that bring together the multiple factors that have coalesced in order to steer a country’s pathways for peace. The discussion is not comprehensive and is not intended as an exhaustive examina- tion of all possible actions that were taken to prevent conﬂ ict.

{"page": 219, "text": "tion of all possible actions that were taken to prevent conﬂ ict. This chapter highlights the experiences of countries in addressing the risks of exclusion and mobilization of grievances, especially within the arenas of contestation, as discussed in chapters 4 and 5. While the discussion highlights policy choices or transition moments in country pathways, it is understood that these were all part of longer trajectories. The chapter focuses on domestic actors, including the state, the private sector, and civil society, and it emphasizes the comparative advantages of these different actors. Chapter 7 focuses on the role and contribution of the interna- tional community. As part of efforts to sustain peace, pre- vention requires three areas of action: (1) inﬂ uencing actors’ incentives in favor of prevention, (2) reforming institutions, and (3) investing to address structural chal- lenges. These areas must be addressed simultaneously, rather than sequentially. In most cases, this has involved constantly monitoring and mitigating short-term risks in order to anticipate shocks and prevent them from triggering violence and taking advantage of transition moments while also addressing structural risks. This chapter describes country experi- ences in building on transition moments and engaging across the three areas of action: inﬂ uencing incentives, transforming institutions, and targ"}

This chapter describes country experi- ences in building on transition moments and engaging across the three areas of action: inﬂ uencing incentives, transforming institutions, and targeting structural fac- tors. This does not imply that all actions fall neatly or exclusively into these categories. In reality, many actions have multiple effects. For example, efforts to promote inclusion in the security forces address both an institutional factor (reform of the security sector) as well as a structural one (historical exclusion that underlies disproportionate access to security), while also shifting incentives (creating stronger"}
{"page": 220, "text": "184 Pathways for Peace sanctions against violence). This study does not assume that all actions referred to were undertaken for the sole purpose of prevent- ing violent conﬂ ict, as many were guided by other objectives. However, all have demonstrated transformational 2 potential to curve a society’s pathway toward sustain- able peace. Navigating T ransition Moments Transition moments enable new efforts to prevent or recover from violence (World Bank 2011, xvii). They may occur at any point along a country’s trajectory and pro- vide a window of opportunity whereby actors can change the direction of a path- way. As discussed in chapter 3, a peaceful pathway often results from actions taken during multiple transition moments rather than a single event. These moments open or facilitate opportunities for actors to address underlying grievances through institutional reform or investments, develop a national implementation plan, rally support for the plan among all segments of the popula- tion, and signal the importance of equitable and inclusive development. By their very nature, transition moments are difﬁ cult to predict and anticipate and, indeed, may present themselves when actors least expect them and are often ill-prepared to act on them. Transition moments come in many forms and can be triggered by a conﬂ uence of internal or external factors. In some cases, they occur suddenl"}

In some cases, they occur suddenly: natural disasters or economic shocks, political changes such as elections or new constitutions, or actor-related changes such as the death of a leader can shift incentives quickly. Other transition moments emerge more gradually. While the Revolution of 2011 in Tunisia, for example, represented a turning point for the country, it resulted from a buildup of grievances related to unmet expectations. This transition moment led to civil protests, which paved the way for a transition from authoritarianism toward a more open and inclusive political system (T oska 2017). A second transition moment occurred with the shared realization that political deadlock put economic stability and political progress at risk, and a power- sharing agreement then opened a path to further reform. Managing Outbreaks of Violence In many cases examined for this study, the way in which national actors managed out- breaks of violence became a transition moment. Violence can bring society to a crossroads, with a choice between continu- ing to escalate the violence or interrupting the violence to create an opening for a shift in direction.

{"page": 220, "text": "hoice between continu- ing to escalate the violence or interrupting the violence to create an opening for a shift in direction. The introduction of a peace- keeping mission or a cease-ﬁ re, as happened in Liberia and Timor-Leste in 2006, can alter the incentives toward negotiations. Mediation and diplomacy can also reroute an incendiary situation. For example, in Kenya, in 2008, the intervention of a coali- tion led by Koﬁ Annan interrupted tit- for-tat violence that was escalating and gaining momentum. It opened a window of opportunity for resolution via dialogue (Lindenmayer and Kaye 2009). The ability to recognize a transition moment and act in a swift, decisive manner is key. The 2012 oil shutdown in South Sudan and border war with Sudan demon- strated the rapidity with which the situation could deteriorate in the nascent country (V erjee 2017). It also presented an opportu- nity for the international community, led by the African Union and widely sup- ported by key donors and allies, to seal the September 2012 Cooperation Agreement between Sudan and South Sudan. While this was a crucial step forward, the agree- ment itself did not account for struc- tural weakness and ongoing violence within South Sudan, and few of the commit- ments to the agreement have since been met (V erjee 2017).

{"page": 221, "text": "Country Approaches to Preventing Violent Conﬂ ict 185 Harake 2017). A ﬁ scal shock in these environments—for example, linked to a terms of trade adjustment, a collapse in com- modity prices, or a fall in tax revenues—can force the government to make unexpected ﬁ scal adjustments, cut consumption subsi- dies, or reduce the civil service wage bill. In many of the country cases examined for this study, maintaining macroﬁ scal sta- bility has created a hard imperative for transition in critical areas, for example, reform of subsidies. Such reforms offer a distinct development opportunity in that they free up public resources and allow countries to reap sizable beneﬁ ts in terms of overall social welfare, economic efﬁ ciency, and ﬁ scal stability. 3 However, subsidy reform is complex in itself (Carey and Harake 2017; Vagliasindi 2012) and can act as a trigger of violence (Clements et al. 2013; OECD 2011, 2012). 4 Cases of reform reversal in Jordan (2011), Indonesia (2012), and Thailand (2013) all point to the politi- cal difﬁ culties of staying the course. Moreover, they underscore the ﬁ scal risks associated with reversals in the reform pro- cess (Inchauste and Victor 2017). 5 The tim- ing of cuts also needs to be chosen carefully—for example, when prices are already low—and the country should receive adequate support from the interna- tional community and multilateral institu- tio"}

Combining subsidy reform with robust safety nets helps to mitigate the risk of destabilization. An effective communica- tions strategy can help to secure buy-in from a broad set of domestic and interna- tional stakeholders. 6 Y et, social safety nets and direct compensation programs are rarely effective in identifying and properly targeting those who lose out from subsidy cuts. 7 This ineffectiveness can fuel griev- ances and fray the social contract that helps to maintain a measure of stability in many low- and middle-income countries, on the assumption that the public tolerates less-than-perfect governance because essen- tial goods are subsidized.

Capitalizing on External Shocks Exogenous shocks such as natural disasters or major shifts in the global economy can paradoxically reset dynamics for prevention by altering incentives and shaking up entrenched positions. The Boxing Day tsu- nami in 2004 is often noted as having helped to push through agreement in Aceh, Indonesia. The tsunami damaged many existing institutions, including much of the military’s control infrastructure, and pre- cipitated a humanitarian crisis that incen- tivized the rebels to come to the negotiating table. The inﬂ ux of some US$7 billion in aid resources for rebuilding, combined with a collective focus on common goals of recovery and reconstruction, provided a platform from which the community could renegotiate norms and expectations.

Northern Ireland’s peace process was advanced by the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, which delegitimized the use of terror tactics (Walsh 2017; box 6.1) and increased pressure on all sides to seek solu- tions through peace talks.

The Anglo-Irish Agreement was struck in 1985, giving Ireland input into the administration of Northern Ireland, pending the development of devolved institutions accepted by both communities. In the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, Ireland deleted its territorial claim to Northern Ireland from its constitution, and the British government acknowledged that it would “stay out of the way” if both parties were for Irish unity.

Once the need for alternative approaches was recognized at government and nongovernment levels, enough momentum for change was created to consider compromise. Important opportunities for changing the dynamics were created when the United Kingdom and Ireland joined the European Economic Community in 1973. Membership gradually strengthened Ireland’s own sense of legitimacy and sovereignty, through interaction with and recognition of an important international institution on its own terms. This critical third-party relationship opened opportunities for informal discussions on social and economic changes. It helped to strengthen avenues for inﬂ uence other than violence and to change the perception of violence as a worthwhile option. The fruit of this relationship was the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985. This 20-year relationship laid the groundwork for the approval of substantial resources from the European Union (EU), which were essential to putting the peace process into action.

A policy of equal recruitment and a completely new identity, including name and uniforms, helped to balance power institutionally and symbolically and to open doors for overcoming divisions. Means for prevention were strengthened substantially by international resources. The EU’s commitment over recent decades of some 2 billion provided a common concern for both sides. Through the relationship came an investment of both money and time. The ﬁ rst EU program, PEACE I, was an investment over 5 years (1994–99). PEACE II was for 7 years (2000–07), and PEACE III was for 13 years (2007–20), reﬂ ecting the gradual strengthening over two and half decades—the minimum timeframe in which transition toward sustainable peace can be expected. At the same time, the United States worked to reduce the means for violence by advocating that Irish Americans support the deal rather than provide tacit or ﬁ nancial support for a cause using violent tactics.

Progress became possible again once decommissioning was renegotiated as a gradual process, rather than as a prerequisite to talks. This agreement aligned better with the time necessary to build trust and establish alternative institutions for conﬂ ict resolution. Global events were powerful in both propelling the conﬂ ict early on and helping to improve political inclusion to prevent further violence later. The original protests against unionist rule drew inspiration from the U.S. civil rights movement. Global events such as the political and social changes that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 caused a rethinking of dogmatism.

Those attuned to this dynamic can recognize and capitalize on such moments. Hurting stalemates—situations where neither side can win, but neither wants to retreat—can play a decisive role in the deci- sion to lay down arms (Brahm 2003; Day and Pichler Fong 2017; Zartman 2001). This was seen in the decision by combatants in Sierra Leone to end the conﬂ ict and sue for peace.

In Indonesia, too, a sense of fatigue contributed to the Malino II Accord that halted hostilities between Christian and Muslim militias in Maluku and Sulawesi after the parties had mutually exhausted one another’s organiza- tional capacity for violence (Jaffrey 2017). In the Central African Republic, the wide- spread desire among much of the popula- tion to see the back of violence has been cited as one of the glimmers of possibility for resolution in the war-torn country; there is hope in the mere existence of a strong desire among Central Africans to ﬁ nd a way out of vicious cycles of conﬂ ict (Lombard 2017). Changing Actors’ Incentives The incentives and interests of actors go to the heart of whether prevention efforts are successful.

Incentives and means for resolution and prevention efforts, while ultimately locally dependent, drew heavily on regional and international relationships and institutions. Resources and relationships from the EU and various U.S. administrations were critical in changing political calculations to prioritize prevention. Ongoing prevention continues to rely on exercising political inclusion, now institutionalized, to navigate difﬁ cult actor-related, institutional, and structural factors, such as the effects of separation from the EU.

Clear, decisive leadership exerts a powerful inﬂ uence on the calculus of other actors. For example, Mahatma Gandhi in India and Nelson Mandela in South Africa built and guided broad coalitions with a vision for social and political change. Leaders can promote institutional change and build or activate coalitions that rally support, spread risk, and create oppor- tunities. Leaders are often in a unique posi- tion to identify and act on transition moments or opportunities for prevention; through the careful use of narrative, they can invoke or shape norms and values that can underwrite prevention—both in moments of crisis and over time. In many of the case studies examined for this chapter, decisive leadership has pro- vided the incentives for peaceful contesta- tion of power. For example, in Burundi, President Pierre Buyoya demonstrated political willingness to build an inclusive government that helped to bring about the Arusha Accords in 2000 (Nygård et al. 2017).

Strong and visionary leadership follow- ing the ﬂ ush of a peace agreement and ces- sation of hostilities remains a critical element in sustaining a country along a peaceful pathway and in building on early gains. The role of leadership was central to ensuring the continuation of peace in Liberia and Sierra Leone following the end of the bloody conﬂ icts in the Mano River basin. In the wake of peace agreements in Liberia and Sierra Leone and the resolution of postelection tensions in Côte d’Ivoire, each country’s president was credited with steering a pathway toward improved rela- tions with donors, improved economic gov- ernance, and a more open and inclusive democratic environment (Marc, V erjee, and Mogaka 2015). Decisive leadership also involves gambles that can sometimes come at steep personal cost.

The move found favor with various elements in gov- ernment, including the military leadership. However, the eventual secession was unpop- ular among some Indonesians and may have cost President Habibie, who had previously indicated that he was not in favor of full secession, his position two months later (Jaffrey 2017). Changes in leadership can pave the way to an alternate course of action and enable a deescalation of tensions. The departure of leaders who have contributed to the escala- tion of violence and conﬂ ict through intran- sigence and self-interested behavior has created opportunities for transition toward prevention and peace. In Malawi, the death of President Bingu wa Mutharika in 2012 opened the door for new leadership in the form of his Vice President Joyce Banda. Her appointment—and strong connection to civil society—helped to defuse tensions and move the country away from the confronta- tion and violence that had been stoked by a combination of a crackdown on civil liber- ties, economic mismanagement, and efforts to centralize executive power (Stackpool- Moore and Bacalja Perianes 2017).

Diplomacy and mediation have at times succeeded in shifting the incentives of lead- ers, especially during a crisis and in concert with pressure exerted by local and national actors: • The mediation that followed Kenya’s 2007–08 election violence is one exam- ple of this (Lindenmayer and Kaye 2009). When talks stalled, the lead mediator, Koﬁ Annan, made a public statement, emphasizing the agency and responsibility held by President Mwai Kibaki and the leader of the opposi- tion, Raila Odinga. By underscoring that “peace lay on the shoulders of the two more powerful leaders in the country, ” he placed the onus on them to act in the best interests of the country and its peo- ple in the medium term (Lindenmayer and Kaye 2009). • In Burkina Faso, the international com- munity, regional partners, and domestic actors all worked via diplomatic means to inﬂ uence the calculus of President Blaise Compaore, who had escalated tensions by pursuing efforts for constitutional change.

He also requested safe passage out of the country. This engineered compromise helped to transfer power to President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, temporarily averted a slide into civil war, and opened the possibility—albeit short-lived—of resolution (T oska 2012).

Investing in and supporting middle-range leaders is an important component of prevention. Faith-based leaders can be particularly well placed to challenge violent narratives and, in particular, to prevent violent extrem- ism within a culturally appropriate frame- work, as seen in Indonesia (Mirahmadi, Farooq, and Ziad 2012; box 6.2).

Hailed as a success of the regional preven- tive architecture, the effort was facilitated by coordination between internal and regional actors, led by ECOWAS, which balanced internal negotiations with diplo- matic pressure. This engagement, backed by credible threats of military action, delivered clear preventive beneﬁ ts in the immediate term and enabled longer- lasting, structural change, a task that would fall largely to domestic actors (Steven and Sucuoglu 2017). In South Sudan, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development sought to pro- vide an umbrella intervention ensuring that regional rivalries did not sabotage peace efforts (V erjee 2017). Although criti- cized for lack of results, the coalition it built constrained the pursuit of individual national interests by Sudan and Uganda, eliminated forum shopping by the parties, and produced a rare demonstration (albeit short-lived) of unity between all the regional actors, the African Union, and other international partners that led to the signing of a peace agreement in Au"}

Civil Society Actors in Coalitions Civil society plays a strong role in fostering social cohesion and collective action for peaceful pathways (Aslam 2017) by build- ing relationships across groups in every- day interactions. For example, analysis of interethnic and intraethnic ties in India ﬁ nds that interethnic organizations are more effective at preventing the escalation of communal violence than intraethnic organizations, because they strengthen social and civic ties (Varshney 2002). 8 This social trust forms the basis for collective action. Several large-sample studies have demonstrated that civil society mobiliza- tion tends to be overwhelmingly peaceful and oftentimes more successful than movements that employ violence: • A cross-country study of the 25 largest social mobilization campaigns between 1900 and 2006 shows that nonviolent movements achieve their objectives at least half of the time compared with 26 percent of the time for movements that turn to violence (Stephan and Chenoweth 2011). • The greater the support that nonvio- lent moments can muster, the higher the chances that governments will seek accommodation, as seen in Serbia 9 in 2000"}

Civil society groups often play import- ant roles in peace processes by increasing accountability among conﬂ icting parties and potentially endowing the process with greater public credibility (Chataway 1998; Lanz 2011; Wanis-St. John and Kew 2008). Given the role that perceptions of exclusion play in increasing the risk of violence, sev- eral studies have shown that bringing civil society groups into peace negotiations or decision making can increase the chances of addressing the underlying causes of the conﬂ ict r"}

Women’s groups campaigned actively against wartime rape and advo- cated on behalf of women’s issues, while local and international civil society groups worked to defuse tensions at var- ious junctures. Civil society was initially conﬁ ned to the sidelines of the Liberian peace process, which contributed, in part, to ﬂ awed agreements that only reﬂ ected the interests of combatants (Marc, V erjee, and Mogaka 2015). Their eventual inclu- sion in the Accra peace talks in 2003 was due to widespread recognition of their contribution in making peace deals stick and the desire to represent the interests of a wide range of groups in society. Civil society was also ultimately included in the power-sharing agreement that emerged from those talks (Marc, V erjee, and Mogaka 2015). • In Sierra Leone, too, the Inter-Religious Council of Sierra Leone played an active role in building conﬁ dence and trust between the government and rebels, during and after the 1991–2002 civil war there, and is credited with preventing the emergence of religious schisms in such a fraught env"}

Inclusive coalitions consisting of civil society actors can also incentivize peaceful dialogue that can foster trust, hold different actors to account, and mobilize collective action. Civil society can provide a vehicle to mobilize groups around common values, purposes, and interests and to foster con- vergence across social cleavages and reli- gious boundaries: • The Tunisian Nobel Peace Prize–winning Quartet coalition represented a wide range of sectors and values in Tunisian civil society: working life and welfare, principles of the rule of law, and human rights (T oska 2017). It was formed in 2011 to advance peaceful democratic development, just as the democratiza- tion process risked collapse. The Quartet brokered a national dialogue between the governing administration and the opposition, which resulted in a roadmap to new elections. Tunisia’s strong civil society tradition and this broad spec- trum of interests gave the Quartet moral authority in exercising its mediation role (World Bank 2015b).

These practices can instill a sense of cooperation, solidarity, and public spirit among participants and can help individuals to develop organizing, mobilizing, and problem-solving skills (Marc et al. 2012, 106). Private Sector Presence in Coalitions Peacebuilding organizations have increas- ingly identiﬁ ed the potential of private sector actors to work for peace and are seeking innovative ways by which to mobi- lize them to this end as part of coalitions. International Alert, for instance, works with private sector companies with the aim of helping a country to “turn its back on conﬂ ict and move towards lasting peace” (Wennmann 2017, 8).

In South Africa, a move- ment led by business leaders facilitated the country’s transition from the apartheid era to a multiracial state. The Consultative Business Movement was born in August 1988, forged from an understanding that the traditional methods of interaction adopted by the business community with mainly black unions and political leaders were “inad- equate” (Ganson 2017, 5). During 1988 and 1989, the movement initiated broad-based bilateral consultations with political parties, civil society, the media, and private sector actors. T ogether with the South African Council of Churches, it convened a process that led to the 1991 National Peace Accord, which set the stage for constitutional negoti- ations and put into motion South Africa’s transition to democracy (Ganson 2017). In this case, the private sector was able to act as a “stabilizing agent” in the transition because it occupied the space between the apartheid regime and the African National Congress and thus could credibly promote dialogue, trust building, and consensus building. The private sector can exert its inﬂ uence within society to sue for peace in various ways and help to inﬂ uence actors’ incentives toward a peaceful pathway.

In Kenya, pri- vate sector actors skillfully deployed their leverage and inﬂ uence during the 2007–08 postelection crisis for peaceful ends (Austin and Wennmann 2017). The long-standing patronage system that has fostered strong bonds between actors in the private and public sectors gave business leaders an edge lacking in other actors (Bigsten and Moene 1996; Hope 2014). On this basis, private sector actors such as the Kenya Private Sector Alliance intervened to help to end the crisis and have since continued to engage in peacebuilding activities by funding peace forums, preventing incite- ment, disseminating conciliatory narra- tives, negotiating privately with political leaders, organizing presidential debates, and maintaining neutrality (Goldstein and Rotich 2008; Materu 2015; Owuor and Wisor 2014; Wachira, Arendshorst, and Charles 2010). Similarly, in Northern Ireland, the Confederation of Business Industry and other business associations formed the Group of Seven, which used media and publicity campaigns to highlight the beneﬁ ts of a peace dividend and pushed for a resolution to the conﬂ ict (Peschka 2011).

As private sector activity cuts across all socioeconomic strata, it can also help to foster inclusion and social cohesion and to address grievances related to socioeconomic exclusion: • In Sri Lanka, a group of members from regional chambers of commerce across the country promoted joint initiatives between Muslim, Sinhalese, and Tamil businesses as well as policy advocacy (Peschka 2011). • In the Philippines, La Frutera and Paglas Corporation set up a banana plantation in a marginalized area and employed Christian and Muslim workers, some of whom were former combatants, and thus helped to promote religious toler- ance and reconciliation (International Alert 2006). • In Colombia, the Footprints of Peace project, run by the Federación Nacional de Cafeteros coffee guild, worked to build local peace between 2011 and 2015 in some of the country’s most violent areas (Miklian 2016). It succeeded in mitigating some risks of conﬂ ict through “community development, economic engagement, and reconciliation-based peacebuilding” (Miklian 2016, 3).

Similar initiatives focusing on human trafﬁ cking and slavery have also been introduced recently in California and the United Kingdom, requiring ﬁ rms to disclose their efforts to monitor and prevent these activities within their supply chains. At the level of governments, 52 countries have also implemented the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) standard requiring them to disclose annually infor- mation on how the revenue from natural resources makes its way through the gov- ernment and how it contributes to social spending. Dependence on foreign demand where issues are sensitive can also be a pow- erful tool for responsible business conduct and conﬂ ict prevention, as long as there is a ﬂ ow of information on ﬁ rms operating in sensitive markets (box 6.3).

In addition to their role as mediators and promoters of economic stability, private sector actors often adopt conﬂ ict-sensitive business practices. These practices require ﬁ rms to desist from contributing to conﬂ ict dynamics, human rights violations, corruption, or any type of criminal activity. Impetus to observe such practices comes from growing recognition that being perceived to fuel or contribute to conﬂ ict can have commercial, reputational, and ﬁ nancial repercussions. Private businesses can operate in a conﬂ ict-sensitive manner by adapting to the local context and incorporating an understanding of conﬂ ict risks and a philosophy of “do no harm” into their operations. The private sector contributes to prevention when it aligns its activities with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for example, by adhering to the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights or joining the UN Global Compact, which helps companies align their strategies and operations with universal principles of human rights, labor, the environment, and anticorruption.

Over the years, some leading ﬁ rms have gradually shifted their strategies from running “safe operations” (protecting their own employees and assets) to building “safe communities” (taking action to address conﬂ ict risks in local communities). One example of such an approach is the Niger Delta Partnership Initiative, established in 2010, to which Chevron committed millions of dollars of investment and leveraged additional funds from donor agencies (Chevron Corporation 2014). An independent assessment after six years found that its programs had helped to achieve widespread change by bringing international attention and private investment to the Niger delta. This oil- rich region has suffered the effects of extensive environmental damage from extractive industries, which has affected the livelihoods of the local populations. The partnership’s greatest impact has been in development and peacebuilding, creating a positive environment for economic growth and peace to take hold.

Norms provide a shared frame- work through which actors and leaders can manage contestation in an equitable man- ner, including through the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and thus reduce the risk of conﬂ ict becoming violent. Norms are often undergirded by narratives that appeal to core values and notions related to constructs of identity, making them a potent force both for prevention and for mobilization toward violence. Given the well-recognized power of nar- rative to amplify values and norms in sup- port of either peace or violence, leaders and those lobbying them have often looked to craft or sway narrative as a way to shift incentives (Sargsyan 2017). Narratives can draw on values of identity, belonging, rights, territory, or culture. They can be called on to respond to signs of conﬂ ict or to carve out an alternative pathway (Zartman 2015).

Following the trou- bled 2012 elections in Ghana, a body- builder group called Macho Men for Peace and Justice promoted a narrative to change the image of “macho men” from the stereotype of thugs for hire at the bidding of corrupt politicians to con- structive protectors of peace and democ- racy (Bob-Milliar 2017). • The Media Foundation for West Africa’s monitoring of hate speech and inde- cent campaign language is testament to the negative power of narrative and the need to reinforce efforts to counter it (Tietaah 2014). • An examination of the blogosphere in Pakistan ﬁ nds that, while peacebuild- ing efforts on the Internet might not match the level of blogging activity seen by extremists, peaceful social coalitions of citizens can and do emerge in the Internet space (Naseem, Arshad-Ayaz, and Doyle 2017).

Narratives have signiﬁ cant power to work for negative ends, too, and can be manipulated to engineer a context that encourages violence. This was exempliﬁ ed in the insidious effects of hate speech or “coded language” that was used to deadly effect in Kenya during the preelection vio- lence of 2007–08 and in Rwanda during the genocide in 1994 to deepen ﬁ ssures in society, delegitimize certain groups within society, and justify the use of violence against them (Somerville 2011). Often, this speech is perpetuated by leaders and inﬂ u- ential actors and disseminated through social and broadcast media (Deb, Donohue, and Glaisyer 2017). The Internet is playing an increasingly inﬂ uential role in transmitting and spread- ing hate speech, and this has led to a much-debated push in some countries, including Kenya and South Africa, toward greater regulation (Nyathi and Rajuili 2017). The more recent phenomenon of “fake news” experienced in many coun- tries, including Germany and the United States, is another example of how informa- tion can be manipulated or instrumental- ized to reinforce a certain narrative and further an agenda or attain a speciﬁ c objec- tive (Gu, Kropotov, and Y arochkin 2017).

In times of crisis, the country’s leadership leverages this sense of solidar- ity as a way of managing and mitigating tensions between groups (Pérouse de Montclos 2017). Narratives and norms can be institu- tionalized and have a more sustainable impact on pathways to peace by promoting civic values and a culture of peace through peace education, 10 civic education, public memorialization, and arts and culture (UNHRC 2016). Reﬂ exively promoting civic values and strengthening a sense of citizenship can help to maintain and safe- guard institutions.

The government of Nepal signed an agreement with the high commis- sioner for human rights to establish an office with a far-reaching mandate on human rights. The mission aimed to reduce impunity on both sides of the conflict and to strengthen the national capacity to protect human rights. Its presence is credited with helping to lessen abuses, torture, and disappear- ances and with encouraging both sides to do more to limit civilian deaths.

Gender norms can also be called on to mitigate tensions and promote peace. One of the best-known examples is that of Liberian women evoking norms of mascu- linity to pressure men to continue peace negotiations and empowering women in their traditional conﬂ ict resolution roles (Marc, V erjee, and Mogaka 2015). Women came together to institutionalize a more permanent way of mediating local disputes and preventing violence, while nurturing an ethic of peace and fostering social cohesion (Alaga 2010; box 6.4). Development and peacebuilding institu- tions have, in recent decades, placed a greater priority on mobilizing women’s efforts for peace, drawing on the roles they often play in society as connecters and trust builders. National action plans for the implementa- tion of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, designed to increase women’s partici- pation in dialogue and peacebuilding, draw on this role, while efforts to prevent violent extremism often focus on women as critical actors for moderating extremist messages and preventing radicalization (Sisk 2017; UN Security Council 2000).

Particularly in postconﬂ ict settings, sports are seen as both a method of programming for reconciliation and development work (such as youth livelihood development) and a symbolic metaphor for peaceful coex- istence and indeed “normality” in social relations. Practically, sports are used to spread the values of human rights, dignity, inclusion, and participation of all and the peaceful resolution of disputes. Recent research from Northern Ireland shows that appropriately designed sports inter- ventions can help to overcome problems of symbolic competition and territorial segregation with the representation of new, less distinct, and divided identi- ties (Mitchell, Summerville, and Hargie 2016).

As the “immune system” of a society (World Bank 2011, 72), effective institutions strengthen resilience to shocks and enhance the capacity for peaceful mitigation of con- ﬂ ict. Institutions provide the regulatory framework, both formal and informal, gov- erning actors’ behavior and limiting the harm individuals and groups can inﬂ ict. The quality and legitimacy of institutions reﬂ ect social relationships in broader soci- ety, and institutions evolve together with those relationships. In contexts with deep tensions across groups, institutions may be more exclusionary, more biased, and less trusted by underrepresented groups. Reform of institutions, therefore, presents an important opportunity for prevention. Across the country cases prepared for this study, efforts to increase the represen- tativeness and reach of institutions have tended to see a reduction in the risk of violent conﬂ ict.

As described in chapters 4 and 5, increas- ing access to the power and governance arena creates strong disincentives for violence, especially when power-sharing arrangements are enshrined in formal agreements, such as new constitutions. Over time, the beneﬁ ts of political inclusion, such as increased inﬂ uence, greater access to information, and the means to pursue collective interests nonviolently, can have a powerful effect on actors’ incentives for prevention: • In Northern Ireland, the experience of gaining inﬂ uence through participat- ing in political discourse and seeing the utility of compromise strengthened Sinn Fein’s motivation to invest in more peaceful conﬂ ict resolution processes (Walsh 2017). • In Ghana, greater political inclusion and openness created an enabling environ- ment not only for a robust political oppo- sition to form and unrepresented groups to participate, but also for a vibrant civil society t"}

Thus, nontraditional and informal mechanisms of inclusion and outsourc- ing can also help to maintain regime stability and create an alternative kind of order that enables the conditions for averting immediate threats of violence (Ahram 2011).

One of the factors that has helped Niger to maintain relative stability in a region beset by security crises has been the move to institutionalize greater political inclusion at the national level. The transition from a military regime to an inclusive civilian-led regime in 2011 saw a change in Niger’s for- tunes and helped to maintain stability in the face of various internal and external threats (Pérouse de Montclos 2017). The new president, Mahamadou Issoufou, ush- ered in a parliamentary regime that extended political inclusion to a range of groups and parties, including naming vari- ous opposition leaders to government posts and appointing a Tuareg, Brigi Raﬁ ni, to the post of prime minister in 2011 (Pérouse de Montclos 2017).

The state supports secularism but also engages in an active dialogue with religious authorities, with Islam playing a central role in Niger. The religious community has supported conﬂ ict mitigation activities in the southwest since 2011; today, most religious actors in the southeast reject the Islamist narrative of Boko Haram. However, this rejection has not entirely mitigated the risk of radicalization toward violent extremism among the youth.

The inclusion of dominant local elites and minority representatives at all levels has helped to achieve stability. This stability is a product of both the elite pact that lasted between 2011 and 2015, which ensured a fair distribution of power and rents between elites, as well as a tradition of nationalist sentiment that has helped to keep elites integrated and united. At the national level, Niger introduced multiparty politics in 1991 and returned to a parliamentary system in 2011, following the end of a military hiatus that lasted from 2010 to 2011.

The pressure for a regime to survive or persist can incentivize temporary mechanisms for inclusion over institutional reform. Inclusion through the redistribution of favors, privileges, or some control of the use of force can reduce tensions and increase incentives to refrain from violence. However, this redistribution can come at the expense of a comprehensive reform of institutions or improved state capacity and, ultimately, lasting prevention: • For example, the Republic of Y emen’s 2013 National Dialogue Conference ultimately failed to bring about much- needed structural changes, despite being hailed as an inclusive and representa- tive process that brought in the political elite, traditional leaders, the Houthis, the southern militant group Al Hirak, civil society, and women’s and youth groups (Steven and Sucuoglu 2017). Although the process agreed on a draft document and wide-ranging recommendations, the decision by a small presidential panel to divide the Republic of Y emen into a federation of six geographic entities perceived to enjoy unequal access to resources ultimately contributed to an escalation of violence and a full-ﬂ edged military conﬂ ict (Steven and Sucuoglu 2017). • In the Democratic Republic of Congo, successive political regimes since the 1970s have relied on alt"}

Ultimately, though, without corre- sponding improvements in state capability, efﬁ ciency, and accountability or efforts to lay the groundwork for a more durable set- tlement, prevention is unlikely to be sus- tained. Such arrangements have tended to work only so long as the pool of elites to co-opt is of a manageable size, incentives remain aligned, or the arrangements have the backing of a strong or canny leader. In Côte d’Ivoire, for example, the founding president, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, ran an closely with the army as well as with the various sectoral ministries, local administration, and traditional authorities.

In 2006, the government passed a law to redistribute 15 percent of revenues from extractive industries back to the communes where the mining takes place. However, this mechanism is contested and has not yet been implemented, mostly because of the lack of capacity to manage resources at the central level and the dwindling of mining resources.

Gender inclusion has proven a powerful element in helping to ensure that processes move beyond dialogue to meaningful change. UN Security Council Resolution 1325 articulates this approach and has enabled global norms on gender equality to inﬂ uence many peace negotiations as well as broader development plans in a manner that goes beyond the simple inclu- sion of women at the table (OSAGI 2000; UN Security Council 2000).

The lessons in many cases, however, high- light that whether reforms are managed or imposed, reform is a fundamental part of sustaining peace. The monarchies in Jordan and Morocco withstood the revolutions that swept the Middle East through the Arab Spring in part due to the plausible promise of politi- cal and economic reforms and the prospect of those reforms translating into real inclu- sion (T oska 2017). Both countries also rely on access to rents in the form of foreign aid as one means of maintaining stability, and their kings are protected, in part, by the dual elected and royal structure of their states. These structures allow concessions to greater political reform, without undermin- ing or threatening elites, and promote sta- bility, at least while the arrangements endure (T oska 2017).

In Ghana and Kenya, decen- tralization transferred greater resources and control to historically marginalized regions (Bob-Milliar 2017; Mogaka 2017): • In Ghana, a gradual increase in trans- fers of funds from the central to local government, in particular, to poorer dis- tricts in the northern region, took place over a decade (Bob-Milliar 2017). The process was set in motion by President Jerry Rawlings and ratiﬁ ed four years later in the 1992 constitution.

In both cases, the focus was on fostering a sense of political inclusion at local levels. In Kenya, the National Cohesion and Integration Commission was established to ease concerns that the tendency to central- ize national structures would be mirrored at the county level; it also helped to facilitate discussions on political cohesion in local communities (Mogaka 2017). A sense of political inclusion was reinforced through the so-called “negotiated democracy” model, whereby some counties brokered deals to ensure adequate community repre- sentation in positions of leadership, enabling individuals to vote across ethnic lines with the expectation that their com- munity would be adequately represented regardless (Mogaka 2017). Where decentralization has worked well, control of power and resources has been traded, ﬁ rst, to manage frustrations stem- ming from horizontal inequalities and long-standing tensions relating to exclusion from political power (Nygård et al. 2017) and, second, to manage resources more efﬁ - ciently.

While decentralization has been instrumental in averting potential violence or diffusing ongoing violence, it has also created short-run risks for violent conﬂ ict. This is particularly the case where elite competition is transferred to the local level or local governments lack legitimacy (Nygård et al. 2017): • An extensive decentralization pro- gram in Indonesia in 2001 led to major transfers of administrative, polit- ical, and ﬁ nancial authority to district and municipal levels (box 6.6). In the short term, the devolution of power and funds increased opportunities for contestation at the local level, as groups jockeyed to position themselves favorably during the process (Bertrand 2004). Once implemented, decentral- ization heightened the stakes for access to resources from the central govern- ment, and political elites exploited ethnic identity as a way to mobilize their bases (Jaffrey 2017). After 2004, however, the country moved into a sta- bilization phase, which was attributed to public satisfaction with decentral- ization, greater space for the expression of local identities, greater levels of state penetration, effective design of local elections, and strong leadership and institutional frameworks at the local level (Steven and Sucuoglu 2017). • In Kenya, too, devolution brought chal- lenges (Mogaka 2017).

It heightened the stakes of politi- cal ofﬁ ce at the local level and raised the specter of violence around elections at the county level. Balancing the way in which power in the counties is shared by elites from different communities remains a signiﬁ cant challenge (World Bank 2017a). Where decentralization has failed to take effect, the failure is largely because it has been implemented incompletely or because political actors and leaders have had little or no incentive to see such wide-ranging changes take effect. Decentralization in Mali, although viewed as the main vehicle for conﬂ ict prevention, did not achieve its aims due to incomplete implementation amid “considerable resistance to change from ofﬁ cials at central and regional levels who stand to lose power when the capacity of local authorities is increased” (Bøås et al. 2017).

To address the grievances that were intensifying secessionist sentiment, the government recognized that ceding some central control of both power and resources was necessary to improve social stability and ﬁ nd resolution. Further motivation to decentralize came from the economic crisis the country faced in the 1990s. In return for taking the political and practical risks of decentralizing, the government also recognized the potential of more ﬁ scally efﬁ cient approaches to governance and resource management across the country’s highly complex social makeup and geographic territory.

These changes were underpinned over the longer term by gradually improving political inclusion.

Indonesia worked to increase citizen trust in security forces by dividing the police from the military and setting up an oversight body within Parliament (Jaffrey 2017; box 6.6). The reform of the security sector in Tunisia, where the abuses and impunity of the inter- nal security institutions served as a catalyst for the protests that ended the rule of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, involved a move from “a police order to a police ser- vice” (Hanlon 2012, 8). The reform reorga- nized the security services into three bodies—the National Guard, the National Police, and Civil Protection (Hanlon 2012). Northern Ireland also underwent an exten- sive reform and transformation of police and policing mechanisms that involved cre- ating an independent police ombudsman to encourage local accountability (Groenewald and von Tangen 2002).

In Burundi, a focus on maintaining parity in numbers between Hutus and Tutsis in military recruitment helped to promote inclusion and reconciliation (Samii 2013).

Reforms began with the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement in 2000, which set the course for the country’s emergence from 12 years of devastating civil war. After a long legacy of military domination of politics, the military itself was interested in professionalizing and rebuilding its reputation. Although still facing serious political and practical challenges, the relative success of the military reforms is noteworthy for the level of broad acceptance they achieved. This appears due to the inclusive and integrated approach to reform. Burundian military reforms, with international support, set out to be inclusive in two main ways: ﬁ rst, in addition to operational capability, reforms explicitly considered governance across multiple areas of government, prioritized political dialogue, and gradually included civil society and the experiences of neighboring countries; second, the Arusha Agreement stipulated that no more than 50 percent of the armed forces could be drawn from any one ethnic group and that membership was open to all Burundian citizens, including rebel factions.

Over time, levels of comfort and even comradery grew in a way that outpaced those in the wider communities, despite ongoing political divisions. International support for development of the police service from the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in particular, was crucial. It provided not only funding but also impartial expertise, which enabled depoliticization of the police service. By 2008, the police service was almost entirely locally led. Community conﬁ dence in the police grew signiﬁ cantly, especially for Kosovo-Albanians who had not shown any conﬁ dence in police previously.

The second-generation changes to security reforms put more emphasis on a holistic, locally led approach. Once the donors’ footprint in the reform process had started to decline, many instrumental reforms were brought about, increasing public trust in the state security and justice institutions. National actors became more assertive in leading the reform process, leveraging civil society, and engaging both formal and informal security providers. These inclusive steps “fostered slower, but deeper, more multifaceted, and therefore more sustainable societal, political, and cultural transformations concerning the role of security sector institutions in Timorese society.” Instituting community policing, devolving conﬂ ict resolution to communities where appropriate, and creating interlinkages between formal and informal institutions all sought to improve inclusion.

Establishing Forums for Peaceful Conﬂ ict Resolution In the more successful cases, reforming institutions to foster incentives for peace has transcended a focus on national institutions and peace processes to focus on strengthen- ing coordination across and building links between the myriad bodies that bear some responsibility for peacebuilding. A key les- son has been that, while national reforms play an important role, they are insufﬁ cient in themselves to support sustained peace. Local-level mechanisms offer a unique van- tage point and cultural relevance for addressing conﬂ ict early on, while being contextually appropriate. However, they are limited in their reach if not embedded in a regional or national framework. Similarly, national policies and strategies that do not connect to local initiatives will struggle to gain traction on the ground (Giessmann, Galvanek, and Seifert 2017).

There is no single ready-made model for I4P, and each country has to tailor it to its historical, institutional, and structural conditions. The concept was originally formulated in the 1980s by Lederach (1997), based on his experiences with local and national peace processes and the use of commissions in peace negotiations. I4Ps can only be put in place through nationally owned and driven processes, but they are enhanced through global experience in building peace architectures to ﬁ t local needs. At different stages, they can also serve as an exit strategy for peacekeeping and political missions as well as development actors. They offer an assurance to national actors of the persistence of national institutions and constituencies that work for sustainable peace.

The positive impacts seem to stem less from efforts to address a speciﬁ c grievance (lack of education) than from indirect effects (the role of educa- tion in improving lives generally). Support for education signals government intent, providing conﬂ ict resolution tools, addressing the social acceptability of violence, and strengthening a sense of conﬁ dence in the future. The evidence is particularly strong for the link between government expenditure on education and availability of secondary education (particularly for young men) and peace (Nygård et al. 2017). Ghana and Northern Ireland both focused on education as a means of furthering social inclusion (Bob-Milliar 2017; Walsh 2017). Resolving Land- and Resource- Related Grievances Grievances relating to perceptions of unfairness and exclusion in access to and ownership of land can heighten the risks of violent conﬂ ict. Left unaddressed, they rep- resent a major source of risk, particularly where grievances have deep historical antecedents, as seen in chapter 5.

Land, territory, and the lack of institutional security for land tenure in rural areas were at the heart of the conﬂ ict. Disputes over land between tenants and large- scale farmers began as early as the 1920s and were core to the long-running civil war. Cycles of violence continued, fueled, in part, by unresolved land questions and calls for land reform, and were accompanied by massive land seizures and the forced displacement of roughly 2 million small-scale farmers from rural land to urban areas (World Bank 2016d). Tensions brought about by structural inequality, political exclusion, and forced dispossession of the land by large landowners erupted into war in the 1960s, spurred by the leftist ideology espoused by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army.

The conﬂ ict escalated in the 1980s, as armed groups found new sources of ﬁ nancing in the illegal drug trade. The number of displaced rural dwellers peaked in 2002 at 447,429. In all, the conﬂ ict displaced between 3 million and 5 million people. In 1997, the government passed the ﬁ rst comprehensive law (Law 387) with measures to prevent forced displacement and to address challenges faced by its internally displaced citizens, including loss of productive assets. The Victims and Land Restitution Law of 2011 created the formal framework for the restitution of land to internally displaced persons. Between 2002 and 2014, donors supported and funded a three-part program to promote the protection, formalization, and restitution in order to support internally displaced persons and the peacebuilding process. Through systematic data collection and research to address speciﬁ c land tenure issues, the project built the knowledge base and policy support for the Restitution Law.

For instance, in Uganda, the Commission for the Return of Properties to Departed Asians legally afﬁ rmed speciﬁ c property rights, thus administering justice and serving the national interest of reestablishing interna- tional recognition and legitimacy of gov- ernment (Colletta and Oppenheim 2017). Some countries have had success in addressing the risks of violent conﬂ ict through schemes to redistribute underuti- lized land, as in Malawi, where the inheri- tance of colonial estates by a small number of large landowners created a situation of frequent land encroachments by a large number of land-poor citizens (Chinigò 2016; Machira 2009). In 2004, amid mount- ing social tensions, the government launched a community-based rural land development project, aimed to redistribute underutilized portions of large estates among the landless poor, around Blantyre, in southern Malawi. The project aimed to transfer land to about 15,000 poor, rural families through subsidized transactions, while also addressing titling and registra- tion of the new holdings. In total, the gov- ernment successfully reallocated 27,988 hectares to 12,656 families and helped to ease tensions among the landless poor in that region, despite coming up against some resistance from large landowners (Chinigò 2016;"}

In Kenya, where contestations over land use and management have also formed the basis of much conﬂ ict, land is likened to the “fulcrum around which everything revolves” (Kanyinga 2005). T o address this, the 2010 constitution provided for detailed policies and the creation of institutions designed to improve the management of land (Mogaka 2017). The National Land Commission was subsequently established to manage public land on behalf of the two levels of government, while the reforms also sought to address the grievances of com- munities and reduce the power of the exec- utive over land management. Although the process has faced numerous challenges, and implementation remains incomplete, prog- ress in land reforms has helped alleviate some of the risks related to land allocation that had been commonplace previously (Mogaka 2017). Some countries have addressed the risk of extractives-related violent conﬂ ict by enhancing transparency in revenue sharing and dealing with perceptions of equity, as well as by devolving greater control of reve- nues to producing regions. Several SDGs offer entry points in this regard. Nigeria, for example, has instituted a formula for dis"}

Nigeria, for example, has instituted a formula for dis- tributing the proceeds from extractives, in a bid to manage tensions related to percep- tions of unfairness in the allocation of resource revenues. Although 95 percent of export earnings and 65 percent of govern- ment revenues in Nigeria came from the oil and gas sector in 2010, only 9 out of 36 states produced oil (Aguilar, Caspary, and Seiler 2011). The northern states have sup- ported the principle of land mass and pop- ulation as criteria for resource distribution, while the oil- producing states have argued in favor of a derivative principle by which they receive larger allocations. Since 1993, 13 percent of oil proceeds have been dis- tributed among the 25 percent of states that produce oil (Eze 2013). As discussed in more detail in chapter 5, the decentralization of natural resource rev- enues and decision making has been seen as a way to counter grievances related to resources at the local level. This approach has had mixed success, however, as in Ghana, where the Mineral Development Fund facilitated local-level revenue sharing but introduced new forms of inequality and reinforced elite capture (Standing and Hilson 2013).

Rebuilding trust and cohesion is therefore a critical element in preventing further cycles of violence. In the case studies prepared for this study, most countries have found it neces- sary to take some measures toward reckon- ing with the events of the past to build the trust to move forward. These efforts have taken a variety of forms. Formal truth com- missions in Sierra Leone and Tunisia brought people together to help close and heal the divides between groups, lessening the threat of a relapse into violence (Ainley, Friedman, and Mahony 2016). In the Central African Republic, a hybrid nation- al-international special criminal court is being set up to address grievances regarding impunity (Lombard 2017). However, it faces multiple challenges, not least being decisions regarding whom to prosecute, how to rebuild trust, and how to avoid the perception that its choices are politically motivated. In some cases, addressing past abuse has been dealt with through less judicial pro- cesses, including ofﬁ cial apologies and truth-telling processes, as in Sierra Leone (Ainley, Friedman, and Mahony 2016; ICTJ 2016) or recognition of suffering and mate- rial reparations for victims, as in Argentina (De Greiff 2008).

Tunisia’s Truth and Dignity Commission established a record on Ben Ali–era abuses, including on sys- tematic corruption, with parallel intent for national criminal prosecutions (ICTJ 2016). These processes have helped to prevent vio- lent outbreaks similar to other Arab Spring political changes. In the Philippines, the recognition of historical injustice over more than 200 years, including state expropria- tion of land of the Bangsamoro community in Mindanao, was part of the comprehen- sive peace agreement in 2014 and helped to alleviate social and political polarization (TJRC 2016). The work of the Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission was car- ried out subsequent to signing of the peace agreement, in spite of the fact that imple- mentation of the agreement had stalled. As discussed in chapter 5, transitional justice mechanisms are often adopted in postconﬂ ict contexts in order to provide recourse for victims of crimes and pro- mote reconciliation. While evidence on the value of transitional justice in preventing recurrence of violence is quite limited overall (Payne et al. 2017), the country experiences examined for this study sug- gest that such measures can help to increase conﬁ dence in a new"}

There are, however, cases where the absence of justice provisions for conﬂ ict-era crimes has helped to bring warring parties together in more informal forums. In Indonesia, the absence of justice provisions in peace agreements helped to bring com- batants to the negotiating table in the short term (Jaffrey 2017). In the long term, how- ever, the absence of acknowledgement and punishment for past abuses has remained an obstacle to the full reconciliation of reli- gious communities in Maluku and Sulawesi. Lack of trust and the memory of ills done have led to a stratiﬁ cation of residential areas and hampered interaction of the two communities (Jaffrey 2017). Conclusion This chapter draws out some common ele- ments of effective prevention based on an analysis of the country cases commissioned for this study. Drawing on the framework for the study, it describes the experience of national actors in three key areas: shap- ing the incentives of actors for peace, reforming institutions to foster inclusion, and addressing structural factors that feed into grievances.

The chapter also high- lights the possible role of the 2030 Agenda. From these experiences, common pat- terns emerge, even if speciﬁ c prescriptions do not. A central dilemma for all countries examined is that the incentives for violence are often certain and speciﬁ c to an individ- ual or group, while the incentives for peace are often uncertain and diffuse (World Bank 2017b).

Governments introduced both long-term reforms or investments tar- geting structural factors, at the same time implementing immediate initiatives that buttressed conﬁ dence in commitments to more inclusive processes. Nevertheless, before or after violence, most of the countries examined that have found pathways to sustaining peace have eventually tackled the messy and contested process of institutional reform to address the risk of violence. Expanding access to the arenas of contestation has been a key part of this effort, in order to increase representa- tion and alleviate grievances related to exclusion. Often, the transition moment that led to sustainable peace was based on a shift away from security-led responses and toward broader approaches that mobilized a range of sectors. In many cases, governments planned socioeconomic development, undertook reforms, launched security operations, and managed political life, even while violence was ongoing. In these experiences, the greatest challenge lay not so much in access- ing knowledge, but in the contentious pro- cess of identifying and prioritizing risks.

Rather than creating the space for the more forward-looking decision making that is needed to establish the institutional or structural conditions for sustainable peace, violence narrowed the options. For this reason, preventive action was at times contrary to popular demands for visible and tangible security measures over lon- ger-term, more complex responses that could address the causes of violence. In these processes, formal political settlements—or at least durable settlements— were important, but also rare events on the pathway for peace. Approaches to prevent- ing violence or resolving violent conﬂ ict, once started, often resulted from govern- ment policies of investment, security, and diplomatic action put in place long before a political process was initiated or formalized. In some cases, political settlements were applied only to address speciﬁ c aspects of conﬂ ict, while underlying causes were tar- geted more comprehensively through gov- ernment action.

Recent analysis reﬂ ecting best practices in subsidy reform calls for the use of social safety nets as a necessary element. 7. Clements et al. (2013) point to Indonesia as an example of successful and thoughtful planning of the use of social safety nets to overcome political economy and social concerns. 8.

According to UNESCO (2008), “Education for non-violence and peace includes train- ing, skills, and information directed towards cultivating a culture of peace based on human rights principles … The learning objectives of peace education may include an understanding of the manifes- tations of violence, the development of capacities to respond constructively to that violence, and speciﬁ c knowledge of alter- natives to violence.

Political inclusion here is used broadly to describe meaningful inclusion of groups or individuals in politically salient dialogue or processes, whether part of formal gover- nance institutions or informal processes (see Call 2012). 12. Here decentralization refers to territorially based autonomous political authority and decentralized political systems. Federalism or decentralization entails regional political autonomy from the capital; it is a combina- tion of self-rule and shared rule that can preserve peace by “retain[ing] the territorial integrity of the state while providing some form of self-governance for disaffected groups” (Bakke and Wibbels 2006, 5). 13.

However, international and regional engagement has proven piv- otal in supporting national pathways for peace. Most of this support has been bilat- eral, but where national interests align, the international community has come together around an international architecture to pre- vent violence and sustain peace. Following World War II, the foundations for this architecture were put in place, rooted in the United Nations (UN) Charter and customary international law. The pri- mary purpose of this architecture is to “maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace. ” 1 Over the last 70 years, this architecture has, arguably, succeeded at its primary aim by providing a framework for continuous consultation that has signiﬁ - cantly reduced the risk of conﬂ ict between the great powers. This success has been achieved in large part by having provided a forum in which the major military powers of our era “debate international problems and seek constructive solutions” (von Einsiedel, Malone, and Ugarte 2015, 828).

Primarily focused on reducing the risks of interstate conﬂ ict, over the past 30 years, this system, with the support of member states, developed what scholars have recently identiﬁ ed as a “standard treatment” for intrastate conﬂ ict: the mediation of political settlements, investment in peace- keeping operations to implement agree- ments reached, and a focus on prevention of abuses (Gowan and Stedman 2018). Despite criticism, this treatment has “achieved stability and security at relatively low cost” in many countries (Eikenberry and Krasner 2017, 9). T oday the international architecture deploys multilateral tools ranging from regional political ofﬁ ces to complex, multi- dimensional peace operations working across development, diplomatic, and secu- rity pillars. In an interconnected world, these efforts are increasingly based on coop- eration between international and regional organizations and engage states in efforts to address international, regional, and subna- tional levels of conﬂ ict.

In particular, the chapter highlights the potential beneﬁ ts of engaging earlier, more comprehensively, and in a more sustained manner to address risks of violence. As chapter 3 notes, the state is the cen- tral actor inﬂ uencing a society’s pathway and the point of reference for preventive action. 2 National governments have the authority and capacity to establish or reform institutions, allocate the resources necessary to tackle structural causes of violence, and address the processes by which the risks of violence manifest. Internationally, governments inﬂ uence country pathways through direct bilateral relations and aid, including security assis- tance (box 7.1), and through interna- tional legal frameworks and multilateral institutions.

Donor countries have used bilateral military cooperation to help institutionalize security systems that protect recipient countries, professionalize the security sector, and forge stronger alliances based on mutual military dependence (Anderson and McKnight 2014; Fisher and Anderson 2015; Poe 1991; Wendt and Barnett 1993). The level of foreign military assistance is not included in the ofﬁ cial development assistance (ODA) ﬁ gures. a This division reﬂ ects a ﬁ rewall between military and development resources and institutions, which contributes to the fact that these two streams often are not coordinated. Indeed, they often are at odds in the material effects and signals about international priorities that they send to the population and to the elites of recipient countries. Harmonizing decisions about military and development cooperation can make them more credible.

While often essential for international security, military assistance has produced mixed results in addressing internal security challenges. As noted in chapter 5, a focus on creating accountable and professional security sector institutions with civilian oversight can facilitate effective conﬂ ict prevention. Most bilateral ﬁ nancing for military and police, however, has gone to enhancing operational capacities rather than to transformative reforms conducive to preventing conﬂ ict and building peace (Bryden and Olonisakin 2010, 9; Donnelly 1997). In addition, bilateral military and police assistance at the country level is not always effectively coordinated, resulting in conﬂ icting or competing interests; a mismatch of standards and approaches with respect to training, equipment, and reform processes; and deﬁ cits in national ownership. a. After 13 consecutive years of increases (from 1998 to 2011), world military spending has plateaued, at an estimated US$1,686 billion in 2016, equivalent to 2.2 percent of global gross domestic product or US$227 per person (Tian et al. 2017).

Systemic prevention addresses transnational risks that can contribute to violent conﬂ ict and be dealt with effectively only by global partnerships. It includes, for example, measures to deal with illicit econ- omies, including trafﬁ cking and the use and trade of arms, all of which are also addressed in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and weapons of mass destruction; address war crimes and crimes against humanity; respond to health epidemics such as human immunodeﬁ ciency virus/ acquired immunodeﬁ ciency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and Ebola; and create broad coalitions to address climate change. Understood this way, prevention lies at the heart of the rules-based international order.

These trends have motivated a new and explicit emphasis within the UN on addressing not only new forms of conﬂ ict, but also all phases of conﬂ ict. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros- Ghali highlighted this focus on conﬂ ict prevention in the 1992 Agenda for Peace, which identiﬁ es as guiding concepts preventive diplomacy, a peacemaking, peacekeeping, and postconﬂ ict peacebuilding (UN Secretary-General 2001). Secretary- General Koﬁ Annan’s 2001 report on the prevention of armed conﬂ ict also emphasizes the mutually reinforcing nature of conﬂ ict prevention and sustainable and equitable development. It states that the primary responsibility for prevention lies with national governments supported by civil society and distinguishes between operational prevention focused on an impending crisis and structural prevention focused on keeping crises from arising in the ﬁ rst place (UN Secretary-General 2001). The 2006 progress report on armed conﬂ ict prevention expands on these concepts, introducing systemic prevention or measures that address global risks of conﬂ ict that “transcend particular states” (UN General Assembly 2006a).

Despite these multiple commitments, three major strategic reviews of the UN’s peace and security functions in 2015 found that prevention remains “the poor relative of better resourced peace operations deployed during and after armed conﬂ ict.” b Building on these 2015 reports, the General Assembly and Security Council sustaining peace resolutions articulated a conceptual vision and operational guidance for member states and the United Nations system. Advancing beyond linear understandings of conﬂ ict prevention, the resolutions concluded that sustaining peace should be “broadly understood as a goal and a process to build a common vision of a society, ensuring that the needs of all segments of the population are taken into account, which encompasses activities aimed at preventing the outbreak, escalation, continuation, and recurrence of conﬂ ict” (UN General Assembly 2016a; UN Security Council 2016).

Chapter VII of the UN Charter provides the framework within which the Security Council may take enforce- ment action. It allows the Security Council to “determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggres- sion” and to make recommendations or to resort to nonmilitary and military action to “maintain or restore international peace and security” (UN Department of Political Affairs 2015b). 3 Through these frameworks, the Secur"}

It has held special or emergency sessions on a wide range of prevention- related thematic and geographic issues. It has adopted declarations on peace, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and inter- national cooperation, notably the landmark resolution on sustaining peace in 2016 (UN General Assembly 2016a).

The UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development encapsulates the increased interlinkages between efforts at systemic prevention. The SDGs call for integrated solutions extending across development, peace, environment, and humanitarian realms and recognize the critical impor- tance of sustainability to development prog- ress as well as the importance of investing in global (and regional) public goods (Framtid 2015; Jenks and Kharas 2016).

Given their knowledge of the regional context and vested interest in preventing regional instability, regional and subregional orga- nizations possess inherent attributes that often afford them greater efﬁ cacy and legitimacy to assume the role of mediators (Ibrahim 2016).

However, when consensus among member states cannot be established, perceptions of par- tiality exist, or critical capacities are in short supply, regional and subregional organizations are faced with difﬁ cult chal- lenges that may curtail their effectiveness in preventing and managing conﬂ ict. International T ools for Prevention Over the past decades, the international community has developed tools for pre- venting the outbreak, escalation, continu- ation, and relapse of conﬂ ict. While historically linked to international multi- lateral institutions, such tools are increas- ingly, if unevenly, shared with regional and subregional organizations.

The following sections provide an overview of several operational instru- ments through which states provide sup- port through multilateral frameworks for prevention, highlighting the evolution of policy, practice, and the extent and poten- tial for greater convergence between international political, security, and devel- opment actors. Early Warning Systems Early warning systems (EWSs) play a sig- niﬁ cant role in the international ﬁ eld of conﬂ ict prevention. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development deﬁ nes early warning as “a process that (a) alerts decision makers to the potential out- break, escalation, and resurgence of violent conﬂ ict and (b) promotes an understand- ing among decision makers of the nature and impacts of violent conﬂ ict”"}

EWSs are practical tools relying on qualitative or quantitative data on medium- and short-term risks, with the intention of directly informing or support- ing preventive actions. EWSs help in for- mulating best- and worst-case scenarios and response options and then communi- cate the ﬁ ndings to decision makers (Mwaûra and Schmeidl 2002). Initial models of early warning emerged in the 1970s. After the end of the Cold War, these systems developed rapidly, using both qualitative and quantitative data to improve the accuracy of predictions and extend their time horizons. T oday diverse types of EWS exist: governmental, intergovernmen- tal, and nongovernmental. 11 • Government systems were designed, for example, in France (Système d’Alerte Précoce, located at the General Secretariat for National Defense) and Germany (BMZ Crisis Early Warning System). • At the intergovernmental level, the African Union has developed a Continental Early Warning System to advise the Peace and Security Council on “potential conﬂ ict and threats to peace and security” and “recommend best courses of action. ” IGAD has designed the Conﬂ ict Early Warning and Response Mechanism (CEWARN) as an"}

It is a collaborative effort of the member states of IGAD (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Uganda). ECOWAS has also developed ECOWARN to collect and ana- lyze data and draft up-to-date reports on possible emerging crises, ongoing crises, and postcrisis transitions. • Nongovernmental organizations have set up their own EWSs. The nonproﬁ t orga- nization International Crisis Group uses qualitative methods and ﬁ eld research to produce a monthly early warning bul- letin, Crisis Watch, designed to provide global warnings of impending violence; the Forum on Early Warning and Early Response–Africa focuses on the Ituri region in the Democratic Republic of Congo; and the Early Warning and Early Response Project focuses on Timor-Leste (Defontaine 2017). 12 Good practices of EWSs include (a) the use of ﬁ eld networks of monitors; (b) appli- cation of both qualitative and quantitative analytical methodologies; (c) use of tech- nology; (d) regular monitoring and report- ing, as conﬂ ict dynamics evolve rapidly; and (e) assurance of a strong interconnection between early warning and response"}

At the same time, even when predictions are accurate, ﬁ nding entry points for action, particu- larly in the context of current conﬂ ict dynamics, can be challenging. However, even the best EWS will have minimal effect if not used to inform preventive action. The short time horizons of warnings can limit the scope of relevant preventive action and make it difﬁ cult to sustain engagement beyond contingency planning. Likewise, EWSs rarely address how much uncertainty is associated with concrete predictions, with the result that action rarely immediately follows warning (box 7.5; Brandt, Freeman, and Schrodt 2011a, 2011b; King and Zeng 2001). For this reason, some countries have devel- oped dialogue processes among a variety of stakeholders to analyze data from different sources and channel this information into more coordinated action. In particular, vio- lence observatories have become common tools to support the design and implementa- tion of violence prevention actions, especially in urban areas.

Observatories usually involve regular meetings by stakeholders from differ- ent sectors—law enfor cement, health, and urban development, for example— to analyze trends in violence and take coordi- nated actions to address it (Duque, Caicedo, and Sierra 2008; Sur 2014). They have been adapted to some situations of armed conﬂ ict, such as Indonesia (Barron and Sharpe 2005). Protection of Civilians and Prevention of Mass Atrocities Human rights violations, discrimination, and abuse are among the major warning signs of instability and conﬂ ict, and moni- toring and reporting of such abuses pro- vide the evidence base from which to devise actions. The UN Charter establishes a link between protection of human rights and maintenance of international peace and security, 14 and the Universal Periodic Review undertaken by the Human Rights Council is the main institutional review mechanism for all 193 UN member states. 15 The power of these systems lies not only in their triggering of action, but also their acceptance as a basis for standard setting across countries. 16 Recognizing that where preventive action fails, interna- tional action must protect the lives and dignity of civilian"}

More recently, systems have evolved to focus speciﬁ cally on the prevention of large-scale and deliberate attacks on civilians. Even when conﬂ ict prevention has failed or no means of stopping armed conﬂ ict are available, prevention of mass atrocities remains a priority. In 2001, fol- lowing the tragedies of the Balkans (A/54/549) and Rwanda (S/199/1257), the UN Security Council invited the secre- tary-general “to refer to the Council infor- mation and analyses within the United Nations system on cases of serious viola- tions of international law” and on “poten- tial conﬂ ict situations” arising from “ethnic, religious, and territorial disputes” and other related issues (UN General Assembly 1999a, 1999b; UN Security Council 2001).

Unlike early warning, forecasting relies on predictive capabilities of data monitoring tools and systems and is designed not to alert observers to impending violence, but to improve remote monitoring of underlying risks through data collection, multimethod and multidisciplinary research, adaption and revision of existing prediction models, and generation of policy-oriented analyses. Prediction models vary, not only in their accuracy in predicting the onset of violent conﬂ ict, but also in their precision in determining location, intensity, and time. While conventional approaches rely on statistical analyses of a country’s structural conditions, open-source information—that is, data from electronic news articles and web resources— is increasingly used for conﬂ ict risk assessment and near-time forecasting (Yi 2017c). • The Political Instability Task Force, a macrostructural country-level forecasting model, has, for example, used a parsimonious selection of variables, focused on types of political regime and the existence of state-led exclusion to predict and explain large-scale violent c"}

Forecasting efforts have also been undertaken to identify risks of violence subnationally. • In Liberia, for example, Blair, Blattman, and Hartman (2015) use 56 potential risk factors to predict locations of conﬂ ict, ﬁ nding that ethnic diversity and polarization consistently predicted the location of violence over time. Another forecasting model using cross- sectional survey data in Liberia predicted up to 88 percent of actual local violence in 2012 and had an overall accuracy of 33–50 percent (Blair, Blattman, and Hartman 2011, 2015; Blattman 2012, 2014). a The ability of qualitative sources to yield robust and policy-relevant predictions (Gibler 2016) is underscored in research that analyzed specialized newspaper content to predict political violence. News sources are not only available in real time, but also have strong country-speciﬁ c elements. Therefore, by using topic models and focusing on within-country variation (o"}

Therefore, by using topic models and focusing on within-country variation (or the timing of the occurrence of violence), researchers could predict accurately the onset of political violence one to two years before it occurred (Mueller and Rauh 2016). Nevertheless, several different metrics b developed to evaluate predictive accuracy have shown that conﬂ ict forecasting still suffers from many limitations. Forecasting is most often based on complex models and is limited by technical and data issues—in particular, too many different variables are playing out in moving from risks to violence for simple modeling to provide a reliable basis for prediction. a. Using cross-sectional surveys of respondents in 242 small rural towns and villages in Liberia in 2008, 2010, and 2012, researchers focused on communal, extrajudicial, and criminal violence. The team used the 2008 data to predict local violence in 2010 and then generated predictions for 2012, while collecting new data to compare the predictions with the reality. b.

The framework highlights eight common risk factors for atrocities, including previ- ous serious violations of international human rights law, the capacity to commit atrocity crimes, and concrete preparatory action. In addition to these common factors, the framework identiﬁ es six risk factors relevant speciﬁ cally to the international crimes of genocide, crimes against human- ity, and war crimes. For example, crimes against humanity are often preceded by systematic attacks against speciﬁ c civilian populations, and war crimes are often preceded by serious threats to humanitarian or peacekeeping operations. The framework also provides detailed indicators for assess- ing these risks. Preventive Diplomacy and Mediation Preventive diplomacy refers to early diplo- matic action taken “to prevent disputes from arising between parties, to prevent existing disputes from escalating into con- ﬂ icts, and to limit the spread of the latter when they occur” (UN Secretary-General 1992, 3).

Mediation is a process whereby a third party assists two or more parties, with their con- sent, to prevent, manage, or resolve a con- ﬂ ict by helping them to develop mutually acceptable agreements. Using conﬁ dence building and lever- age, preventive diplomacy and mediation can play a role in altering the incentives of actors that propel societies toward violence. Given that diplomatic action can be mobilized quickly, when consent is present, it is often a tool of ﬁ rst resort in response to high risks of conﬂ ict and sometimes the only approach, short of military intervention, that can be deployed to avert violence (Day and Pichler Fong 2017). Mediation has also been used increasingly frequently. Greig and Diehl (2012) conclude that there were more mediation attempts during the 1990s (64 percent) than during the entire 1945–89 period, and this trend seems to have con- tinued (Themmer and Wallensteen 2011). 17 Within the United Nations, the establish- ment of regional political ofﬁ ces—the UN Ofﬁ ce for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS),18 the UN Ofﬁ ce for Central Africa (UNOCA), and the UN Regional Center for Preventive Diplomacy in Central Asia (UNRCCA)—has responded to the increasing regionalization of conﬂ ict.

In the Kyrgyz Republic, the EU, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and UNRCCA responded to the 2010 crisis by focusing mainly on capacity building; tack- ling the rule of law; facilitating regional dia- logues, especially around terrorism, water, and energy issues; and providing aid to displaced Uzbeks. This concerted effort enabled the government to end violence and commence a process of political reforms that led to parliamentary elections (Call 2012). Another example is the response of the UN Ofﬁ ce for West Africa (UNOWA) to the crisis in Guinea in 2008 following the death of President Lansana Conté and the takeover of the country by a military junta. With the mediation of the head of UNOWA, Special Representative of the Secretary- General Said Djinnit, and ECOWAS, the sit- uation was diffused.

These efforts include other international and regional organizations as well as nongovernmental actors (in so-called track 2 approaches) and national actors (individual local mediators as well as civil society groups, for example, youth and women’s groups). This collaboration has led to efforts to increase coordination at the international and national levels. At the country level, it has led to broader and more inclusive mediation approaches, including organization of national dialogue initiatives. • In Kenya in 2008, Koﬁ Annan, former UN secretary-general, mediated the end of postelection ethnic violence on behalf of the Panel of Eminent African Personalities of the African Union, with technical support provided by experts from the United Nations and the nongovernmental Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (Crocker and Aall 1999; Lanz and Gasser 2013; Lindenmayer and Kaye 2009). • In the Kyrgyz Republic in 2010, after President Kurmanbek Bakiev’s ouster, a triple mediation initiative of the EU, the OSCE, and the United Nations provided considerable leverage and legitimacy to the"}

At the same time, in some prominent cases—the Syrian Arab Republic most obviously, but also Libya and the Republic of Y emen—the breadth and complexity of the conﬂ ict and the multiplicity of actors involved have deﬁ ed long-standing efforts to secure lasting political settlements. Assessing the effectiveness of diplomacy and mediation faces inherent challenges, since it is hard to isolate the effects of such efforts from the conduct of the conﬂ ict, the parties, and other external actors. Data suggest that, while diplomatic engagement is the most common form of international recourse in violent conﬂ ict, evidence of its ability to halt the outbreak of conﬂ ict is mixed. 20 What is clearer is that mediation alone is insufﬁ cient to resolve underlying causes of violence. While mediators have the potential to help to generate settlement deals that can bring short-term stability, these deals are fragile and more likely to break down than military victories (Hoefﬂ er 2014; Svensson and Lundgren 2015).

Qualitative case studies show that diplomacy, which at its core relies on the “wisdom and appeal of its arguments” (Hinnebusch et al. 2016, 4), has helped to avert or end violence in speciﬁ c cases, but that, even when successful, mediation and elite settlements often provide breathing space rather than long-term solutions (Day and Pichler Fong 2017). These ﬁ ndings, however, require careful analysis of the deﬁ nition of success. 21 A study using the International Crisis Behavior data set of interstate war ﬁ nds that, in cases of conﬂ ict relapse after medi- ated settlement between 1945 and 2005, violence was often reduced in the ﬁ rst years after relapse. 22 Furthermore, when negotiated settlements are combined with third-party security guarantees, such settle- ments extended the duration of peace (Hoefﬂ er 2014; Walter 2017). In sum, diplo- matic action can provide the framework for proposing measures that, if implemented, can consolidate peace. 23 When preventive diplomacy and mediation lead to settle- ments, they can provide much-needed space for other forms of action that address the underlying causes of violence.

States can be sensi- tive to the engagement of outsiders in what are perceived as internal responsibilities. Preventive diplomacy also suffers from a bias toward the national level and underuse of dia- logue processes at the subnational level that involve local actors, including trusted media- tors (Harland 2016). In addition, interna- tional third-party contributions tend to come once a pathway to violence has been set and deviation from the path is more difﬁ cult. Preventing Violent Extremism There is a strong consensus on behalf of many national governments and multilat- eral organizations, including the UN General Assembly, the UN Security Council, and the World Bank, that violent extremism has reached a level of threat and sophistication that requires a comprehen- sive approach encompassing not only mili- tary or security measures, but also preventive measures that directly address development, good governance, human rights, and humanitarian concerns (Rosand 2016; UNDP 2017).

Where violent conﬂ ict exists, efforts must be redoubled to promote and sustain dialogue between warring parties, since persistent, unresolved conﬂ ict has proved to be a major driver of violent extremism (ICG 2016). Therefore, the ﬁ rst of the seven strategic priority areas consists of dialogue and conﬂ ict prevention.

Peace Operations Although not explicitly envisioned in the UN Charter, peace operations remain one of the most widely known international tools for prevention and have evolved sig- niﬁ cantly since 1990, from a narrow focus on monitoring cease-ﬁ res and peace agree- ments to complex multidimensional missions with mandates to consolidate peace, prevent relapse into conﬂ ict, and support the restoration of state authority. While rarely deployed to avert the outbreak of violence, mandates today range from building institutions and facilitating peace- ful dialogue to protecting civilians and upholding human rights (DPKO 2008).

Evidence also suggests that these tools have achieved greatest impact when deployed in a coordinated manner after the outbreak of violence (Hoeffler 2014), for example, when using mediation to encourage a cease-fire or technical support to reinforce policy reforms. However, current trends are testing the limits of the existing tools, and the interna- tional system is struggling to adapt. For example, recent UN reviews highlighting the “primacy of politics” in guiding UN operations point to a more concerted need to address the underlying causes of conﬂ ict across multiple levels.

Development assistance has increased steadily over the past 60 years and is increas- ingly targeted at conﬂ ict-affected and frag- ile contexts. Where it is aligned with an understanding of conﬂ ict dynamics, aid is a very important mechanism to support national and local capacities to build path- ways toward peace. This is especially the case when aid can be designed to address early risks of violent conﬂ icts. Recent inter- national commitments on aid, such as the Paris Declaration (2005), the Accra Action Agenda (2008), and the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States (2011), have recognized the role of development aid in peacebuilding. Over the past decade, the development focus among important bilateral and mul- tilateral agencies has started to shift toward supporting national institutions and actors in conﬂ ict prevention. However, despite calls for greater investment in pre- vention (OECD 2015; World Bank 2011), most aid is still delivered after violence has occurred, and aid ﬂ ows to fragile and postconﬂ ict settings tend to be unpredict- able and inconsistent.

Development aid is still not commonly viewed as a relevant tool for early prevention, and policies that stimulate growth and poverty reduction often are assumed to be sufﬁ cient in and of themselves to reduce the risk of violence. In addition, international development actors and multilateral development banks, in particular, are still highly con- strained from engaging on sensitive issues with governments by their mandates, institutional makeup, and internal culture. At early signs of risk and in precrisis con- texts, these constraints often limit the scope for development programming to address causes of tension and sensitive areas such as security and justice. Aid for prevention also tends to be fragmented, short term, and seen as a complement to rather than an integral part of develop- ment efforts. The Relationship between Aid and Conﬂ ict The question of whether development assistance helps to prevent or fuel violent conﬂ ict has been a matter of debate for decades. Three main theories, discussed in chapter 3, have guided research in this area. Some (Calì and Mulabdic 2017; Dube and Vargas 2013) argue for a “rapacity effect, ” whereby aid essentially creates an incentive for violence because there are more resources to ﬁ ght over.

For example, Nunn and Qian (2014) ﬁ nd a positive effect of U.S. food aid on the incidence and duration of conﬂ ict. 29 Collier and Hoefﬂ er (2004) and Dal Bo and Dal Bo (2011) counter that increasing the available resources (through aid or other measures) creates a disincentive for violence by raising the opportunity cost, especially if resources are allocated in a way that raises wages or redistributes them to would-be combatants. A growing body of research suggests that the degree to which an increase in aid could fuel conﬂ ict depends on the extent to which the aid is fungible and the way the state uses it (Collier and Hoefﬂ er 2006; Langlotz and Potrafke 2016). In particular, country-level aid, especially budget support, is sometimes seen as being much more political and therefore conﬂ ict-inducing than proj- ect-level aid, precisely because it allows a great deal of autonomy over use of the aid (Gehring, Kaplan, and Wong 2017).

However, if the increased military funding is channeled toward more repressive mea- sures seen as illegitimate by the population, it can have the opposite effect."}

Aid projects that provide basic goods (food, water) or improve ser- vice delivery can have different effects depending on how the aid is used and what kind of aid it is. Aid that goes to individual projects can contribute to increased vio- lence if rebel groups are able to appropriate and use it as an incentive for recruitment, or it can reduce violence if it helps to boost incomes and relieve economic stresses in conﬂ ict-affected regions (Anderson 1999; Fearon and Laitin 2003). Because aid is part and parcel of the local context, differential beneﬁ ts from aid can reinforce intergroup tensions and fuel divi- sive narratives of “us” versus “them” (Anderson 1999; Jenny 2017). Moreover, aid can reinforce grievances along identity lines when it lacks impartiality or when it is perceived as biased in favor of speciﬁ c groups irrespective of their need for assis- tance (Carbonnier 2015).

In Timor-Leste, for example, the “Dili-centric” development efforts were thought to worsen the urban-rural divide and contribute to pock- ets of exclusion (OECD 2010). Aid can also create a substitution effect when an action takes over local capacity and reduces or replaces local efforts. This can have negative impacts by reducing the legitimacy of existing structures or authorities. For example, a dual or parallel public sector can detract from important state- and peacebuilding processes that are necessary for the country to earn legitimacy in the eyes of its constituents. Aid also can affect the local market, reinforce market distortions by feeding the war economy, and undermine peacetime production (Kang 2017). Finally, aligning priorities for develop- ment aid can be difﬁ cult, depending on when crisis breaks out. For example, there could be political difﬁ culties in realigning development aid in precrisis contexts or the often-dramatic reprioritization of aid that occurs when crisis breaks out (with empha- sis placed on security or humanitarian expenditures).

Because of these potential negative impacts, linking the delivery of aid to do-no-harm measures is essential to help donors be sensitive to the speciﬁ c con- texts in which they operate. This process includes identifying issues, elements, or fac- tors that divide societies as well as local capacity for peace that brings societies together. It also requires donors to consider what aid will do for whom, who are the responsible actors and stakeholders, and who has access to aid (Wallace 2015). A study conducted at the end of the ﬁ ve-year pilot phase of the New Deal took stock of how bilateral and multilateral donors have conceptualized and implemented their commitment to promote “inclusive and legitimate politics” (INCAF 2017). On the basis of empirical evidence acquired through case studies in four G-7+ pilot countries (Afghanistan, Somalia, South Sudan, and Timor-Leste), the study ﬁ nds that, at best, donors work with an incom- plete and inadequate understanding of the typically fragmented and contested politics of fragile societies beyond the formal repre- sentatives of their governments and admin- istrations (INCAF 2017).

This involvement entails risks: when development aid is channeled primarily through nongovernmental organizations, it can undermine the state’s capacity to play a central role in prevention.

The New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States (box 7.9) provides a guiding framework for this connection.

Finding ways to support national actors in changing course toward prevention, when incentives are strongly aligned against it, requires a level of coordination and sensitivity to local dynamics that is rarely seen. Calls for better coordination are consistently made, agreed on, and later ignored. In many cases, rather than enhancing coordination and efﬁ - ciency, large-scale external aid has produced fragmentation, confronting government part- ners with thousands of projects, many of them short term, and parallel governance and ﬁ duciary systems (Institute for State Effectiveness 2018).

With humanitarian appeals lasting an average of seven years, humanitarian actors have been present in many crises for more than two decades, for example, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, and Sudan (UNOCHA 2015). As highlighted by the World Humanitarian Summit, this funding is unsustainable. Financing requirements for the UN-coordinated humanitarian appeals and refugee response plans increased signiﬁ cantly from US$5.2 billion in 2006 to US$22.1 billion in 2016 (UN 2017). Whereas humanitarian aid also increased from US$3.4 billion to US$12.6 billion during the same period, it increasingly falls short of needs, and only 56 percent of the UN appeals were met in 2016 (UN 2017).

Providing humanitarian aid and meeting international commitments to refugees are important responsibilities of countries, and in the absence of successful prevention of conﬂ icts and disaster risk reduction, it is essential to mitigate the impact of conﬂ ict on the most vulnerable. Since the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016, important efforts have been under way to integrate the provision of humanitarian and development assistance more tightly, recognizing the need to respond simultaneously to life-saving needs, strengthen economic and social resilience, and, where possible, promote peacebuilding in conﬂ ict contexts. The World Humanitarian Summit resulted in important commitments in this regard, with member states and international organizations committing to improve joint planning and aid predictability and to ensure seamless transitions between humanitarian and development assistance. The summit secured, above everything else, key commitments to prevent and end conﬂ icts and leave no one behind. Building on the summit, the World Bank and the United Nations have committed to “engaging earlier to prevent violent conﬂ ict and reduce humanitarian need” (World Bank 2017)."}

The extent of aid dependency also varies signiﬁ cantly within the group. During the same period, the average aid dependency among fragile contexts was 10.5 percent of gross national income (GNI), compared with 2.5 percent of GNI for stable contexts; in Afghanistan, Liberia, and the Solomon Islands, it was around or above 30 percent (OECD 2016). Despite strong arguments for increas- ing aid ﬂ ows before violence takes hold (OECD 2015; World Bank 2011), most aid focuses on postcrisis situations. While humanitarian aid tends to spike during and immediately after conﬂ ict, develop- ment assistance, which represents the bulk of ODA, is most often disbursed only after violence has occurred and declines very rapidly (see, example, ﬁ gure 7.2). Aid volatility poses another set of chal- lenges, especially for countries recovering from violent conﬂ ict.

It has been argued that in high-risk contexts, volatile aid risks amplifying coun- tries’ internal instability (Chandy, Seidel, and Zhang 2016) and constrains the capac- ity for postconﬂ ict recovery. In many protracted conﬂ icts, this volatility in the volume of aid can be exacerbated by sud- den diversion of aid from developmental or institutional development to humanitarian service delivery, and back, as countries undergo repeated cycles of violence (Carver 2017). As the example of the Central African Republic (box 7.13) illustrates, unpredictable aid ﬂ ows are creating major constraints on efforts to prevent the relapse of violent conﬂ icts. Collier and Rohner (2008), noting the negative effects that vio- lent conﬂ ict inﬂ icts on a country’s institu- tions and capacity, argue that aid ﬂ ows would be much more productive if sus- tained over time, as countries rebuild institutions.

Instead, successful conﬂ ict prevention strategies increasingly need to align security, development, and diplomatic action over the long term. Recognizing the potential impact of more coordinated responses, diplomatic, security, and development actors increas- ingly seek to bridge divides and ﬁ nd areas of convergence between international tools in order to harness more coordinated action for prevention. This has been facilitated by the development of institutional platforms for interagency coordination and resource pooling.

In reality, however, the Central African Republic has been the recipient of often large, but extremely volatile, support. In 1998 a UN peacekeeping operation was deployed in the context of army mutinies and in the midst of controversial electoral preparations with a mission budget of approximately US$200 million in 2018 dollars. This mission was replaced on January 1, 2000, by a “peacebuilding ofﬁ ce” with a budget 100 times smaller—approximately US$2 million.

While this evolution is welcome, with conﬂ icts becoming more fragmented, more complex, and more transnational, these tools are profoundly challenged—entry points for diplomatic engagement are harder to ﬁ nd (Gowan and Stedman 2018; Walter 2017), and peace operations are increasingly deployed to insecure environments.

According to the Union of International Associations, intergovernmental organiza- tions are deﬁ ned as bodies that are based on a formal instrument of agreement between national governments, include at least three nation states, and possess a per- manent secretariat performing ongoing tasks. See http://www.uia.org/archive/types - organization /cc. 6. Chapter VIII of the UN Charter recognizes the importance of regional arrangements in support of the maintenance of international peace and security and stresses that “no enforcement action shall be taken under regional arrangements or by regional agen- cies without the authorization of the Security Council” (UN Charter, Ch.

In 2017, for instance, the African Union and the UN signed a framework agreement to strengthen their responses to emerging chal- lenges in key areas such as peace and secu- rity, human rights, and development. See http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?

E). 10. For example, ofﬁ cial development assistance to countries with high risk of conﬂ ict aver- ages US$250 million per year, only slightly higher than that to countries at peace, but increases to US$700 million during open conﬂ ict and US$400 million during recovery years. Similarly, peacekeeping support aver- ages US$30 million a year for countries at high risk, compared with US$100 million for countries in open conﬂ ict and US$300 during recovery (Mueller 2017). 11.

Since the early 2000s, the United Nations has undertaken signiﬁ cant steps to anticipate and prevent violent con- ﬂ ict, and the World Bank is currently devel- oping the Global Risk Scan, a tool designed to identify multifaceted fragility, conﬂ ict, and violence risks in countries across the globe. 12. Some governmental and intergovernmental early warning systems have civil society reporting components, for example, the African Union, CEWARN, and ECOWARN all have links to civil society networks, while early warning systems in the Southern African Development Community and the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region rely on state intelligence (ATF 2016). 13. Third-generation EWSs are located in con- ﬂ ict areas with strong local networks. The objective is to detect conﬂ ict and link EWS to response mechanisms, where monitors act as “ﬁ rst responders.” 14. Article 55 of the UN Charter states that to support the “creation of conditions of sta- bility and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, the United Nations shall promote … universal respect for, and observance of, human r"}

See UN General Assembly (2003), also the “Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action” (World Conference on Human Rights 1993): “The efforts of the United Nations system towards the univer- sal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, contribute to the stability and well-being necessary for peaceful and friendly rela- tions among nations, and to improved con- ditions for peace and security as well as social and economic development,"}

The potential of the Universal Periodic Review to contribute to conﬂ ict prevention and peacebuilding efforts was acknowledged in the sustaining peace resolutions (UN General Assembly 2016b, para. 11; UN Security Council 2016). 16. This has occurred gradually, with member states having ratiﬁ ed universal human rights instruments adopted under the aegis of the United Nations, and organizations like the African Union, the Council of Europe, and the Organization of American States having adopted regional instruments, the imple- mentation of which is supported by civil society organizations and national human rights institutions. 17. Growing conﬁ dence in mediation has resulted in expanded capabilities to support such processes. Despite data gaps, there has been a signiﬁ cant increase in the number of deployed envoys, special advisers, and politi- cal missions over the past 10–15 years. These entities have taken up an increasingly broad range of functions, including early warning and analysis, coordination of regional medi- ation initiatives, and direct support for mediation before, during, and after crises and conﬂ icts. Special political missions alone have increased in number by 70 percent, and spending has increased by a factor of 13, since 2000 (UN Secretary-General 2017a). 18. In 2016, the Secu"}

Special political missions alone have increased in number by 70 percent, and spending has increased by a factor of 13, since 2000 (UN Secretary-General 2017a). 18. In 2016, the Security Council requested the United Nations Ofﬁ ce for West Africa (UNOWA) and the Ofﬁ ce of the Special Envoy for the Sahel to merge into a single entity, the United Nations Ofﬁ ce for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS). 19. Since 2008 the UN’s Mediation Support Unit, with a standby team of senior media- tion experts has provided tailored advice to national negotiators and international mediators (see www.peacemaker.un.org). 20. While qualitative cases indicate the potential importance of diplomatic engagement in both coordinating international and regional action and bridging conﬂ ict parties, few studies have assessed these cases against data. Regan (2010, 2012), building on Goldstone et al. (2010), assesses the success of interventions in countries and periods with a high risk of civil war. Regan (2012) concludes that military interventions increase the likelihood of civil war, eco- nomic interventions have no effect on the likelihood of war, and diplomatic interven- tions decrease the likelihood of war (for example, Hoefﬂ er 2013). 21.

{"page": 300, "text": "he likelihood of war (for example, Hoefﬂ er 2013). 21. The meaning of success is much disputed among scholars of international mediation, and indicators vary substantially. Success rates of mediation have been measured on the basis of whether mediation has been accepted, whether violence has ended, whether conﬂ icting parties have reached a formal agreement, and how long it holds. When measuring success against whether the parties reach any type of agreement (from cease-ﬁ re to comprehensive settle- ment), Wallensteen and Svensson (2014) conclude that 55 percent of mediated pro- cesses fail, in part, because they often do not result in such formalized outcomes. There are also signs that mediation successes are evolving. Building on the UCDP conﬂ ict termination data, Kreutz (2010) has calcu- lated that, in the 1990s, 46.1 percent of con- ﬂ icts that ended by negotiated settlement restarted, but the number of conﬂ icts returning to violence decreased to 21.0 per- cent in the 2000s, suggesting that learning led to more lasting successes later. 22. Bercovitch and Wells (1993) ﬁ nd that in interstate conﬂ icts, 29 percent of mediation attempts resulted in a cease-ﬁ re or more enduring peace. However, Svensson and Lundgren (2015) show that more than 60 percent of cases of mediation led to an abatement of crisis between 1945 and 2005. For other studies on the effectiveness of mediati"}

Data conﬁ rm that multifaceted approaches used in tandem with other tools render mediation more effective. For instance, there is “strong empirical evidence” that media- tion in combination with a peacekeeping operation highly correlates with nonrecur- rence (DeRouen and Chowdhury 2016). Mediated agreements that encompass political, military, territorial, and justice provisions also decrease the risk of recur- rence, although the likelihood of recurrence"}

See http://www.un.org/undpa/en/diplomacy -mediation. 25. Beardsley and Gleditsch (2015) explore whether the deployment of external peace- keepers can prevent violent conﬂ ict from spreading within a country once a civil war has broken out. Using geo-referenced con- ﬂ ict polygons between 1990 and 2010, the authors ﬁ nd that peacekeeping missions that are large, especially when there are many troops, have a strong containment effect. 26. All references to Kosovo should be under- stood in the context of UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (UN Security Council 1999). 27. The practice of peace operations in these areas has been codiﬁ ed in various policy and guidance documents, with support and resources provided through the Ofﬁ ce of Rule of Law and Security Institutions at headquarters level (which also supports special political missions led by the Department of Political Affairs). 28. According to the UN Peacekeeping Operations: Principles and Guidelines (Capstone Doctrine; UN 2008), the role of multidimensional peacekeeping operations is to “create a secure and stable environment while strengthening the State’s ability to pro- vide security, with full respect for the rule of law and human rights; facili"}

More recent studies dispute this link, citing methodological questions (Christian and Barrett 2017) and arguing that the mac- ro-level analysis hides important spatial distribution effects (Gehring, Kaplan, and Wong 2017). 30. In order to enable countries to access ﬁ nanc- ing at early sign of risks of violent conﬂ ict, the World Bank has created a risk mitigation facility under IDA 18 to support countries in their prevention efforts.

While ODA ﬂ ows fell in the mid-1990s because of ﬁ scal consolidations in donor countries, overall ﬂ ows rose again after 1998. 33. According to ofﬁ cial data collected by the OECD Development Assistance Committee. T otal ODA ﬂ ows corresponded to 0.32 per- cent of GNI of member countries in 2016. Despite the sizable increases, this still falls short of the long-standing 0.7 percent of GNI commitment. 34. A 1988 rule allows donor countries to include the costs of hosting refugees in ODA for the ﬁ rst year after arrival. Development Assistance Committee (2017) notes that efforts are ongoing to revise ODA reporting rules to minimize the risk that spending on refugees diverts from spending on development. 35. The group of 56 fragile contexts deﬁ ned by the OECD hosts approximately 22 percent of the world’s population, but only attracts 5 percent of the global total of foreign direct investment (OECD 2016). 36.

The shift to “bottom-up” approaches is a reaction to important failures of more state-centric approaches to stabilization that were tried in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 2008 and 2011, in which “top-down” approaches to state authority had the result of extending institutions that were perceived as illegitimate, reproduced certain “predatory” characteristics, and failed to provide frameworks for adequate governance of complex local conﬂ ict, social, and other dynamics (De Vries 2016)."}

The costs of destruction and lost economic growth are enormous. So, too, are the costs of response and recovery. Preventing these conﬂ icts would have pro- tected the lives and dignity of millions in addition to protecting substantial develop- ment gains that have, instead, been lost. This study presents the evidence to sup- port a renewed focus on prevention: • Chapter 1 presents the evidence that vio- lent conﬂ ict is increasing after decades of relative decline. Direct deaths in war, numbers of displaced populations, mil- itary spending, and terrorist incidents, among others, have all surged since the beginning of this century. Conﬂ icts are more internationalized, are more pro- tracted, cross borders more often, and are fought by more nonstate actors than in recent decades. • Chapter 2 shows how this rise in violence is taking place in a rapidly evolving global context.

Growing interdependence has created opportunities for development progress, but also ampliﬁ ed the impact of risks that transcend national borders, such as climate change, population movements, and transnational orga- nized crime. • Chapter 3 presents the pathways frame- work, highlighting that conﬂ ict risks exist at various levels and that preven- tive action, as part of efforts to sustain development and peace, needs to iden- tify solutions to imminent or ongoing violence and address underlying risks of conﬂ ict through incentives, institutional reforms, and investment in structural factors. • Chapter 4 shows that grievances related to real and perceived exclusion and inequalities among groups are fueling many modern conﬂ icts. Groups and elites are mobilizing around complex issues of identity and narrative to esca- late and sustain conﬂ ict. The UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is an important vehicle for addressing these risks. • Chapter 5 shows that, to prevent cycles of violence, action must focus on the inter- action among different dimensions of risk across arenas of power, opportunity, ser- vices, justice, and security. States hold the primary responsibility for resolving con- ﬂ icts peacefully in these arenas, sometimes with the support of coalitions of actors."}
{"page": 312, "text": "276 Pathways for Peace • Chapter 6 provides evidence that preven- tive strategies are most effective and can only be sustained when they come from within societies. Many governments at differing levels of capacity are working in concert with national, and often interna- tional, partners to implement a variety of strategies that reduce the risks of violent conﬂ ict by addressing structural factors, institutions, and incentives of actors. • Chapter 7 demonstrates that interna- tional efforts have helped countries to emerge from violence in many set- tings, but are challenged by the growing complexity of conﬂ icts today. Effective preventive action must be grounded in national processes, be implemented when early risks are perceptible, and support initiatives, at various levels, to prevent the escalation of violence. At the center of this study is the appreci- ation that, to be effective, prevention needs to be recognized as the collective responsi- bility of all actors of society and an integral part of our efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Collaborating to revitalize systemic prevention—addressing those risks that no country can address alone and that are in nature international— as well as committing to cooperation and collaboration in the development of tools supporting preventive action in countries and regions at risk of violence are vital. This study posits that prevention enhances sov- ereignty by relying on national capacity and ensuring that international support is based on engagement with states and national actors. The ﬁ rst section of this chapter sets out three principles for prevention. Above all, prevention must be sustained over the time needed to build more peaceful, just, and inclusive societies. Prevention must be inclusive and build broader partnerships across groups to identify and address the grievances that fuel violence. Prevention must actively and directly target patterns of exclusion and institutional weaknesses that increase the risk of violent conﬂ ict. The second section presents an agenda for action for national actors.

This section offers options available for support- ing peaceful pathways by targeting the interaction between grievances and contes- tation across key arenas of power, opportu- nity, services, and security and justice. The third section explores how interna- tional actors can effectively organize for prevention to overcome incentives that undermine their support for national part- ners. It includes a critical look at the organi- zational incentives that frustrate effective collective action and prevent engagement before a crisis reaches its acute phase. Principles for Prevention The evidence amassed by this study indi- cates, overwhelmingly, that, to address the complex and integrated nature of con- temporary conﬂ ict-related risks, preven- tion must be sustained, inclusive, and targeted. Prevention must be sustained. It is easy, but wrong, to see prevention as a trade-off between the short and long term. Preventive action must address immediate crises while investing to reinforce a society’s pathway toward peace. Achieving prevention goals requires ﬂ exibility, and development invest- ments should be integrated into overarch- ing strategies, with politically viable short-term and medium-term actions.

The need for sustainability requires balancing effort and resources so that action does not reward only crisis management. Those working on prevention face irrelevance if their time horizons stretch beyond political and investment cycles (table 8.1). Prevention must be inclusive. T oo often, preventive action is focused on elites. In complex, fragmented, and protracted con- ﬂ icts, an inclusive approach to prevention puts an understanding of grievances and agency at the center of national and international engagement. It recognizes the"}
{"page": 313, "text": "Pursuing Pathways for Peace: Recommendations for Building Inclusive Approaches for Prevention 277 importance of understanding people and their communities: their trust in institutions, conﬁ dence in the future, perceptions of risk, and experience of exclusion and injustice. It uses this understanding to disaggregate risks and build inclusive responses to risk that enhance state legitimacy, reduce polariza- tion, and avert violence. Prevention must be targeted. Preventive action must actively and directly target grievances and exclusion across key arenas of contestation before, during, and after violence. Once group grievances become entrenched, it is harder for leaders and other national actors to ﬁ nd common ground and build consensus for actions that can reduce the risk of violence. An Agenda for Action: Prevention in Practice The principles—sustained, inclusive, and targeted—help to shift thinking about pre- vention; to effect real change, they must be put into practice. This section presents an agenda for action that can guide national actors as they partner for prevention.

Prevention of violent conﬂ ict should be a collective outcome, bringing together security, development, and political efforts around shared priorities, with devel- opment policy as a central instrument for addressing the risk of violent conﬂ ict. The lessons of successful prevention that come across in the study show how national actors, to be effective, need to target several important policy and program areas: 1. Monitoring risks 2. Addressing multidimensional risks 3. Aligning peace, security, and develop- ment efforts 4. Implementing a people-centered approach to prevention 5. Sustaining prevention across levels of risks Monitoring Risks of Violent Conﬂ ict Engaging in preventive action early, before the outbreak of violence, requires a shift from early warning of violence to awareness of risk.

Monitor exclusion . Preventive strategies need to be based on an understanding of the dynamics of exclusion and, more gener- ally, the grievances of social groups. This understanding should be based on regular monitoring of horizontal inequalities among groups or geographic areas and other forms of exclusion, as well as assess- ment of societal cleavages such as gender inequality and youth exclusion. As much as possible, exclusion should be monitored around access to power, resources, services, and security. These efforts should be based on SDG indicators, targeting horizontal inequalities across economic, political, and social dimensions. Several SDGs, including most notably, but not exclusively, SDG 5, SDG 10, and SDG 16, address exclusion. 1 This monitoring requires assessing the intersection of exclusion with broader risks such as climate change. Monitor perceptions and grievances of social groups. Perceptions matter, are not always related to objective data, and are often missed by traditional surveys and reg- ular assessment tools.

Innovative tech- niques, such as high-frequency surveys, polling, and focus groups can facilitate monitoring of public perceptions over time. 2 While monitoring perceptions has become a valuable tool of public policy for- mulation, assessments of individual or group perceptions need to be mainstreamed in preventive action. Perception monitoring needs to be undertaken with full awareness of the need for safeguards related to the security and privacy of individuals, so that the data cannot be used for repression or exclusion based on identity; it also needs to be undertaken with sensitivity to the con- text in which these surveys have been car- ried out (Sartorius and Carver 2008). Strengthen early warning systems. Early warning systems (EWSs) are designed to initiate rapid actions to support prevention from the community level to the regional level. Noting that the risks of conﬂ icts are escalating rapidly and becoming pro- tracted, particularly in border or remote areas, early warning systems that monitor short- and medium-term risks need to be reinforced and linked to appropriate action (Defontaine 2017).

Considerable progress has been made in applying information and communication technologies to collect perception data; such technologlies can be particularly efﬁ - cient in remote and conﬂ ict-affected areas, where exclusion can be felt acutely and where access is often most difﬁ cult. Real- time data collection methods such as crowdsourcing 3 and crowdseeding, 4 social media monitoring, geospatial technology, and mobile data collection tools provide opportunities—many of them low cost—to improve timeliness, detail, and nuance in monitoring. Ensure that survey and data collection is sensitive to conﬂ ict and capacity. 5 The way data are accessed and shared requires strat- egies that balance risks and opportunity. The dissemination of data on group per- ceptions of security, services, resources, and power can, if not carefully used, reinforce polarization (Haider 2014; Putzel 2010). At the same time, limiting data to the use of a narrow group of technocrats can reduce the beneﬁ t of data collection, as the many actors that can play a key role in prevention would not beneﬁ t from this information.

Develop integrated peace and development plans. Responding to complex interrelated risks almost inevitably requires that institu- tions act in concert in support of common objectives using different instruments. This requires a level of integrated planning that is often challenging. Actors working on pov- erty reduction, disaster risk reduction, social service delivery, and environmental man- agement need to come together, at different levels of government, to identify and priori- tize conﬂ ict risks and responses under a sin- gle framework aligned with the SDGs. Such plans should identify collective outcomes across the humanitarian, development, and peace nexus, while respecting their man- dates, bringing together mandates around shared objectives and, where possible, rein- forcing and strengthening capacities at national and local levels.

Border areas and zones of low popula- tion density tend to be particularly vulner- able to risks of violence, as state presence is often weak, delivering services is often expensive, and identifying economic invest- ments with positive rates of return is also a challenge.

Mitigate the impact of shocks when tensions are high. Shocks, whether eco- nomic, political, or security related, can act as triggers for violence. One crucial factor in preventing a shock from triggering a violent response is the ability of govern- ments to address the impact of shocks in a way that is timely and distributes impact fairly. People increasingly expect govern- ments to play a signiﬁ cant role in mitigat- ing the effects of shocks. For governments with limited ﬁ scal space and capability to respond ﬂ exibly and quickly, the support of the international community is key. In all of these cases, it is important to ensure clear communication and outreach to the population to explain the nature of the shocks and the government response. How to do this will depend on the nature of the shock and the speciﬁ c context. Price shocks are particularly sensitive, and mac- roeconomic management is an important tool for prevention.

In high-risk contexts, development planners should recognize that groups with grievances might not be the poorest and might not be in areas of high potential for economic growth, yet failing to make investments that could channel their grievances into productive contestation can lead to vio- lent conﬂ ict, which can wipe out larger development gains. Stability poles should become an important focus of develop- ment actions in areas where risks of vio- lence are high and security is an issue. Security, implemented as a service to the local population, not only serves to iden- tify and address security threats but also is key to protecting rights, property, and economic livelihoods.

Integrate security sector reform with other institutional reforms. While the status quo is that security sector reforms are often addressed separately from other institu- tional reforms, a shift toward preventive action will require that issues of account- ability, procurement, payment, and others follow the same rules for security services as for the rest of the civil service. This is particularly important to ensure transpar- ency and facilitate civilian oversight. In parallel, it is important that support to the security sector be conducted in line with principles of national ownership and in coordination with other sectors. In some cases, a recently concluded peace process can offer an opportunity to promote a cul- ture of transparency and openness and to move toward a “people-centered” approach to security and justice sector reform.

Sustaining Preventive Action across Levels of Risk Different actions are needed in situations of emerging risk, high risk, and open vio- lence and in postviolence contexts. As such, actors across development, security, polit- ical, and humanitarian sectors need to work more closely together across all levels of risk according to their comparative advantages. Figure 8.1 illustrates how this shift could look. In the current paradigm, development actors tend to decrease engagement, or halt altogether, when risks escalate, while political actors enter the scene only once violence is present. This study argues, instead, for a focus on early action by all actors, stronger partnerships, and shared ﬁ nancing platforms that spread prevention throughout policies and pro- grams.

This requires differentiated approaches across levels of risks (described in table 8.3), where existing tools can converge to sustain prevention given the constraints and win- dows of opportunity that these categories of risk can create (ﬁ gure 8.2). Preventing Recurrence The ﬁ ndings of the World Development Report 2011 underscore the high risks of conﬂ ict recurrence in postconﬂ ict environ- ments, particularly if underlying grievances are not addressed in the settlement that ended the conﬂ ict (World Bank 2011).

Civil society and informal institutions play a key role in reducing risks. International experience has shown that measures to strengthen inclusiveness of civil society insti- tutions are effective in rapidly decreasing the risk of conﬂ ict recurrence (Paffenholz et al. 2017). For example, the inclusion of civil society in the negotiation, contents, and implementation of the agreement is a key fac- tor for the success of peace agreements and can help induce governments to show com- mitment to addressing the grievances that have been at the origin of violent conﬂ ict (Lanz 2011; Wanis-St. John and Kew 2008). In many cases, informal institutions such as community leadership, religious institutions, and traditional governance systems can also play an important role in resolving conﬂ icts and avoiding the breakout of violence.

Another major challenge to the provision of the necessary resources for prevention relates to middle-income countries. As chapter 1 shows, conﬂ icts are often seen in such set- tings, yet middle-income countries typi- cally are not eligible for “softer” lending facilities, which can help to incentivize investments in conﬂ ict prevention—that is, concessional ﬁ nancing and grants— and are increasingly facing constrained access to ﬁ nancing.

The World Bank’s Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF), launched in April 2016, provides concessional or “International Development Association–like” ﬁ nancing to help middle-income countries to address the inﬂ ux of refugees, with Jordan and Lebanon being among the ﬁ rst to receive assistance to manage spillovers from the refugee crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic.

{"page": 326, "text": "being among the ﬁ rst to receive assistance to manage spillovers from the refugee crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic. Although conces- sional lending hinges primarily on income level, with the lowest rates reserved for the world’s poorest nations, the GCFF alters this equation by offering concessional ﬁ nancing to countries like Jordan and Lebanon that pro- mote a global public good by opening their borders to refugees. Facilities such as the GCFF will be important sources of funding going forward, especially for incentivizing invest- ments in preventative measures. See http:// globalcff.org/about-us/objectives-and-scope. 8. Since the mid-1990s, the UN “culture of peace” resolutions have recognized the fun- damental link between peace, development, and human rights. In particular, the Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, adopted in 1999, details how actions taken through education; economic and social development; human rights; gender equal- ity; democratic participation; understand- ing and tolerance; the free ﬂ ow of information; and international peace and security can serve to build a culture of peace. Only recently has a concerted effort been made to embed this mind-set and operational approach into the work of the United Nations.

{"page": 336, "text": "ECO-AUDIT Environmental Benefits Statement The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental footprint. In support of this commitment, we leverage electronic publishing options and print-on-demand technology, which is located in regional hubs worldwide. Together, these initiatives enable print runs to be lowered and shipping distances decreased, resulting in reduced paper consumption, chemical use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste. We follow the recommended standards for paper use set by the Green Press Initiative. The majority of our books are printed on Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)–certiﬁ ed paper, with nearly all containing 50–100 percent recycled con- tent. The recycled ﬁ ber in our book paper is either unbleached or bleached using totally chlorine-free (TCF), processed chlorine–free (PCF), or enhanced ele- mental chlorine–free (EECF) processes.
